c
c  Version 1.00 (2008.11.02):
c     A main program version code which perform the same as this web calculator
c     is available on the same web site.
c  Version 1.03 (2010.09.14):
c     1) We add a new output, the age of the universe, to the end of each row
c     in the output file;
c     2) For clarity, in the case of power spectrum type 1, we make use of a
c     new fitting formula to calculate the transfer function, which was provided
c     also by Eisentein & Hu (1998) but does NOT take into account effects of
c     massive neutrinos on the transfer function.
c     Actually, this modification will induce only TINY changes in the final
c     results for universe without massive neutrino, like our concordant LCDM
c     universe.
c     A main program version code and two subroutine version codes which all
c     perform the same as this web calculator are also available on the same
c     web site.
c
c=============================================================================
c  According to Zhao, Jing, Mo & Boerner (2009), this calculator predicts
c     1) the median mass accretion history (the median main branch of merger
c        trees) for halos of any given mass Mobs at any given redshift zobs,
c        M(z|zobs,Mobs), and
c     2) evolution of halo structural properties along this median main branch
c        (such as concentraion evolution c(z|zobs,Mobs), see below for details)
c
c     You may choose to output 
c     a) time evolution of the mass and structural properties along the median
c        main branch of final halos with a given mass Mobs (such as above
c        M(z|zobs,Mobs) and c(z|zobs,Mobs)), OR
c     b) mass dependence of these structural properties at final redshift zobs
c        (such as that of median concentration, c(zobs,M); and you can run
c        repeatedly with many other zobs to obtain the redshift dependence).
c
c     Mass accretion history and concentration evolution history with different 
c     halo definitions are also available.
c     
c     This version can be used for Einstein de Sitter, open, or flat
c     universe with cosmological costant, as some fitting formulae from
c     the literature (such as formulae for halo virial density and for
c     linear growth factor) are limited to these cosmologies.

c  1.Output format:
c
c     output file name: 
c
c        when output type you choose is 'evolution of given halo', properties
c        along the median mass accretion history of final offspring halos of
c        mass lgMobs are output in a file 'mandcoutput.a-random-number'
c
c        when output type you choose is 'dependence on mass', properties of
c        final offspring halos of many different masses at redshift zobs are
c        output in a file of similar name 'mandcoutput.a-random-number'
c
c     both the files have the same format:

c                omeganu0,T_cmb,N_nu,h/note ('---' will take place of
c                those parameters that needn't be input)

c                     dark matter and baryon; 0<omegam0<=1

c
c     following 4 are NOT needed unless ispec=1 (Eisentein & Hu spectrum), and
c     from the release of version 1.03, omeganu0 and N_nu of the 4 parameters are
c     NOT needed any longer even for ispec=1, as we adopt a new fitting formula
c     to calculate the transfer function, which was provided also by Eisentein &
c     Hu (1998) but does not consider effects of massive neutrinos on the transfer
c     function:
c        omegab0  --  baryon density at redshift 0 in critical units

c                     0<=omegab0+omeganu0<=omegam0

c
c     following are for the spherical virial halo definition

c                     case with ispec=0, see below)
c                     (when nbin1=1) for the final offspring halo of logarithmic
c                     mass lgMobs and its main progenitors;
c                     Miz=M(ziz|zobs,Mobs)
c                     (when nbin1>1) for final offspring halos only; lgMobs is
c                     renewedly uniformly choosed in (7,16) or so;
c                     Miz=M(zobs|zobs,Mobs)=Mobs
c        c        --  halo virial concentration
c                     (when nbin1=1) c=c(ziz|zobs,Mobs)
c                     (when nbin1>1) c=c(zobs|zobs,Mobs)=c(zobs,Mobs)
c        rhohiz   --  corresponding halo virial density at redshift ziz, in 
c                     [h^2 M_sun/Mpc^3]
c        R        --  halo virial radius, in [Mpc/h]
c        V        --  halo circular velocity at virial radius, in [km/s]
c
c     following are some characteristic inner quntities
c        Rs       --  halo characteristic inner radius Rs, in [Mpc/h]
c        Ms       --  mass enclosed in Rs,                 in [M_sun/h]
c        rhos     --  density at Rs,                 in [h^2 M_sun/Mpc^3]
c        Vs       --  circular velocity at Rs,             in [km/s]
c
c     following are for some other halo definitions 
c      rhohiz_200c--  200 times critical density at redshift ziz, in
c                     [h^2 M_sun/Mpc^3]
c        Miz_200c --  corresponding halo mass with halo density equal to 
c                     rhohiz_200c, in [M_sun/h]
c        c_200c   --  corresponding halo concentration with halo density
c                     equal to rhohiz_200c
c      rhohiz_200m--  200 times universe mean matter density at redshift
c                     ziz, in [h^2 M_sun/Mpc^3]
c        Miz_200m --  corresponding halo mass with halo density equal to 
c                     rhohiz_200m, in [M_sun/h]
c        c_200m   --  corresponding halo concentration with halo density
c                     equal to rhohiz_200m
c
c     For the case of power-law power spectrum (ispec=0), the age of the
c     universe and all halo properties, except concentration, have been
c     scaled respectively with universe age at redshift 0 and corresponding
c     quantities of halos of mass M_star0 at redshift 0. For example, in
c     this special case, universe age, halo mass and radius are in [uniage0],
c     [M_star0] and [R_star0] respectively.
c
c     For main progenitors that are the earliest (also the smallest)
c     in the output file, if Miz is less than 25 times of the smallest
c     main progenitor, negative c, Ms, rhos, Rs, Vs, Miz_200c, c_200c,
c     Miz_200m and c_200m will be output (because the characteristic time
c     t_0.04 has to be computed, see Zhao et al. 2009).
c
c     For users interested in different halo definitions: For the second
c     output type, mass dependences of halo properties in DIFFERENT HALO
c     DEFINITIONs are all output as shown above. For the first output type,
c     the halo mass input, lgMobs, should always be VIRIAL mass, even though
c     masses in other halo definitions are output again as shown above. If
c     you want to output property evolution for final offspring halos of
c     a given mass in ANOTHER HALO DEFINITION, i.e., if you want to start
c     from a mass in another halo definition, you may do it in two steps:
c     1. by choosing the output type 'dependence on mass', you can obtain
c     one-to-one correspondence among halo masses in different definitions
c     at the redshift in consideration for the current cosmology; 2. by
c     choosing the output type 'evolution of given halo' and specifying
c     the corresponding virial halo mass, you will get the history you want.

c  Plotting results:
c
c     You may find some sample Super Mongo macros in file 'mandcweb.sm', which
c     can be used to plot both 1) mass & redshift dependence of halo median
c     concentration c(z,M) and 2) evolution of halo properties along its
c     mass accretion history, such as M(z|zobs,Mobs) and c(z|zobs,Mobs).
