Welcome to Galacticus

Welcome to the Galacticus project. Galacticus is a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation - a powerful toolkit for modeling the physics of how galaxies form.
For more information please see the [wiki](https://bitbucket.org/galacticusdev/galacticus/wiki/Home), and for description of the physics see the [description paper](http:arxiv.org/abs/1008.1786) on Galacticus.
