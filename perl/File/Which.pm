=head1 NAME

File::Which - Portable implementation of the `which' utility

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  require File::Which;                  # exports which()
  require File::Which qw(which where);  # exports which() and where()
  
  my $exe_path = which('perldoc');
  
  my @paths = where('perl');
  - Or -
  my @paths = which('perl'); # an array forces search for all of them

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<File::Which> was created to be able to get the paths to executable programs
on systems under which the `which' program wasn't implemented in the shell.

C<File::Which> searches the directories of the user's C<PATH> (as returned by
C<File::Spec-E<gt>path()>), looking for executable files having the name specified
as a parameter to C<which()>. Under Win32 systems, which do not have a notion of
directly executable files, but uses special extensions such as C<.exe> and
C<.bat> to identify them, C<File::Which> takes extra steps to assure that you
will find the correct file (so for example, you might be searching for C<perl>,
it'll try C<perl.exe>, C<perl.bat>, etc.)

=head1 Steps Used on Win32, DOS, OS2 and VMS

=head2 Windows NT

Windows NT has a special environment variable called C<PATHEXT>, which is used
by the shell to look for executable files. Usually, it will contain a list in
the form C<.EXE;.BAT;.COM;.JS;.VBS> etc. If C<File::Which> finds such an
environment variable, it parses the list and uses it as the different extensions.

=head2 Windows 9x and other ancient Win/DOS/OS2

This set of operating systems don't have the C<PATHEXT> variable, and usually
you will find executable files there with the extensions C<.exe>, C<.bat> and
(less likely) C<.com>. C<File::Which> uses this hardcoded list if it's running
under Win32 but does not find a C<PATHEXT> variable.

=head2 VMS

Same case as Windows 9x: uses C<.exe> and C<.com> (in that order).

=head1 Functions

=head2 which($short_exe_name)

Exported by default.

C<$short_exe_name> is the name used in the shell to call the program (for
example, C<perl>).

If it finds an executable with the name you specified, C<which()> will return
the absolute path leading to this executable (for example, C</usr/bin/perl> or
C<C:\Perl\Bin\perl.exe>).

If it does I<not> find the executable, it returns C<undef>.

If C<which()> is called in list context, it will return I<all> the
matches.

=head2 where($short_exe_name)

Not exported by default.

Same as C<which($short_exe_name)> in array context. Same as the
C<`where'> utility, will return an array containing all the path names
matching C<$short_exe_name>.


=head1 Bugs and Caveats

Not tested on VMS or MacOS, although there is platform specific code
for those. Anyone who haves a second would be very kind to send me a
report of how it went.

File::Spec adds the current directory to the front of PATH if on
Win32, VMS or MacOS. I have no knowledge of those so don't know if the
current directory is searced first or not. Could someone please tell
me?

=head1 Author

Per Einar Ellefsen, E<lt>per.einar (at) skynet.beE<gt>

Originated in I<modperl-2.0/lib/Apache/Build.pm>. Changed for use in DocSet
(for the mod_perl site) and Win32-awareness by me, with slight modifications
by Stas Bekman, then extracted to create C<File::Which>.

Version 0.04 had some significant platform-related changes, taken from
the Perl Power Tools C<`which'> implementation by Abigail with
enhancements from Peter Prymmer. See
http://www.perl.com/language/ppt/src/which/index.html for more
information.
