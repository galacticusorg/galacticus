istarfo   10.0       sets the kind of SF law:
# istarfo=0  SFR from che_evo code
# istarfo=1  no more used
# istarfo=2  no more used
# istarfo=3  no more used
# istarfo=4  SFR from semianalytical hierarchical clustering models
# istarfo=5  as 4 but writes only files with SFR including bursts
# For istarfo=0 the residual gas fraction can be imposed, when 
# required, through gastmp and igastmp in section MAIN.
#
#ssp_mass4  5.015    Salpeter IMF with Mlow=0.15Mo
ssp_mass4  2.950    Kennicutt IMF with Mlow=0.15Mo
# ssp_mass4 = IMF mass integral from Mlow to 120Mo;used for istarfo=4.
# for Mlow=0.15, ssp_mass4= 5.015, 2.950, 5.920 for Salpeter, Kennicutt, k1p
# for Mlow=0.1, ssp_mass4= 5.862, 3.065, 6.036 for Salpeter, Kennicutt, k1p
# For istarfo=0 it is read in the SFR file. It is used to normalize the
# SSP spectra (set in section SSP). Note that the SSP are computed for a 
# given IMF (slopes and mass limits), thus the only meaningful IMF variations.
# NB rescaling using ssp_mass4 only done for SSPs marked 1 below (i.e. normal)
# not for those marked 2 (i.e. burst)
#
tgal      13.0      age of the model
# NOTE: when tgal < 0 it is ignored and 
# 1) for istarfo=0 is read in age.par:
#    this is a trick to be used in programs running GRASIL for the same
#    model at different ages. See for instance program AGETAB.
# 2) for istarfo=4 tgal is reset to tb+abs(tgal)*te, where tb and te are
# the time and e-folding time of the last burst listed in bursts_bulge file.
extflag   1.0       if 1.0, the effective optical thickness 
# tau_eff = sqrt(tau_a*tau_e) is used in the diffuse component,
# if 0.0 tau_a is used
#lam_tru   100.0
#exp_tru   1.3           
# lam_tru is the wavelength in micron above which the slope of the dust absorption
#efficiency is set equal to exp_tru. These parameters are optional. 
gastmp    6.0e-4    if igastmp=1 then gas mass is forced to 
# gastmp*(final total mass in .sf file), if igastmp=0 then gastmp is not
# used and the actual gas mass at tgal, as listed in .sf file is adopted
# istarfo=0 and igastmp=1
igastmp   0.0       see gastmp
mmolfraz  0.25      fraction of molecular over total gas
# NOTE: if mmolfraz<0 no gas, useful for bare EPS
# if mmolfraz>1, then it is reset to min(1,SFR(tgal)/mmolfraz), 
# where SFR is in Msun/yr. This is used to have mmolfraz proportional to SFR.
mcloud    1.0e6     Mass (Msun) of molecular clouds (MCs)
# NOTE: if mcloud<0, then -mcloud is interpreted as the required 1 micron 
# optical depth of clouds, and mcloud is reset accordingly.
rcloud    16.0      radius (pc) of molecular clouds
vout      -1.0      [Gyr^-1] see below.  If <0 is set to 1/etastart.

idz       1.0            
# if idz=0.0 dsug is simply the dust/gas mass ratio. If idz=1.0

# factor between Z and dust/gas.
# In this case dsug=0.45 gives the standard DL dsug=1/110 for Zsun

#ndr       10.00     use this to speed up test runs
# 40 is usually a good choice for moderate optical thickness. Increase
# when energy is badly conserved; ndr has no effect for

#  if ntstart present, the original etastart is multiplied by ntstart, to cope 
#  with the lower amount of cirrus dust
