modeling of non-equilibrium primordial gas chemistry and cooling
dicussed here with cosmological hydrodynamics. We derived new fits of
rate coefficients for the photo-attachment of neutral hydrogen, the
formation of molecular hydrogen via H{\textasciicircum}-, charge exchange between H\_2 and
H{\textasciicircum}+, electron detachment of H{\textasciicircum}- by neutral hydrogen, dissociative
recombination of H\_2{\textasciicircum}+ with slow electrons, photodissociation of H\_2{\textasciicircum}+,
and photodissociation of H\_2. Furthermore it was found that the
molecular hydrogen produced through the gas-phase processes, H\_2{\textasciicircum}+ + H
--{\textgreater} H\_2 + H{\textasciicircum}+, and H{\textasciicircum}- + H --{\textgreater} H\_2 + e{\textasciicircum}-, is likely to be
converted into its para configuration on a faster time scale than the
formation time. We have tested the model extensively and shown it to
agree well with former studies. We further studied the chemical kinetics
in great detail and devised a minimal model which is substantially
simpler than the full reaction network but predicts correct abundances.
This minimal model shows convincingly that 12 collisional processes are
sufficient to model the H, He, H{\textasciicircum}+, H{\textasciicircum}-, He{\textasciicircum}+, He{\textasciicircum}++, and H\_2 abundances
in low density primordial gas for applications with no radiation fields.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the Sixth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. With this data release, the imaging of the northern Galactic cap is now complete. The survey contains images and parameters of roughly 287 million objects over 9583 deg2, including scans over a large range of Galactic latitudes and longitudes. The survey also includes 1.27 million spectra of stars, galaxies, quasars, and blank sky (for sky subtraction) selected over 7425 deg2 . This release includes much more stellar spectroscopy than was available in previous data releases and also includes detailed estimates of stellar temperatures, gravities, and metallicities. The results of improved photometric calibration are now available, with uncertainties of roughly 1\% in g, r, i, and z, and 2\% in u, substantially better than the uncertainties in previous data releases. The spectra in this data release have improved wavelength and flux calibration, especially in the extreme blue and extreme red, leading to the qualitatively better determination of stellar types and radial velocities. The spectrophotometric fluxes are now tied to point-spread function magnitudes of stars rather than fiber magnitudes. This gives more robust results in the presence of seeing variations, but also implies a change in the spectrophotometric scale, which is now brighter by roughly 0.35 mag. Systematic errors in the velocity dispersions of galaxies have been fixed, and the results of two independent codes for determining spectral classifications and redshifts are made available. Additional spectral outputs are made available, including calibrated spectra from individual 15 minute exposures and the sky spectrum subtracted from each exposure. We also quantify a recently recognized underestimation of the brightnesses of galaxies of large angular extent due to poor sky subtraction; the bias can exceed 0.2 mag for galaxies brighter than r=14 mag.},

	abstract = {The relation between galaxy stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity is a 
sensitive diagnostic of the main processes that drive galaxy evolution,
namely cosmological gas inflow, metal production in stars, and gas
outflow via galactic winds. We employed the direct method to measure the
metallicities of {\textasciitilde}200,000 star-forming galaxies from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey that were stacked in bins of (1) stellar mass and (2) both
stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) to significantly enhance the
signal-to-noise ratio of the weak [O III] lambda4363 and [O II]
lambdalambda7320, 7330 auroral lines required to apply the direct
method. These metallicity measurements span three decades in stellar
mass from log(M sstarf/M \&sun;) = 7.4-10.5,
which allows the direct method mass-metallicity relation to
simultaneously capture the high-mass turnover and extend a full decade
lower in mass than previous studies that employed more uncertain strong
line methods. The direct method mass-metallicity relation rises steeply
at low mass (O/H vprop M sstarf 1/2) until it
turns over at log(M sstarf/M \&sun;) = 8.9 and
asymptotes to 12 + log(O/H) = 8.8 at high mass. The direct method
mass-metallicity relation has a steeper slope, a lower turnover mass,
and a factor of two to three greater dependence on SFR than strong line
mass-metallicity relations. Furthermore, the SFR-dependence appears
monotonic with stellar mass, unlike strong line mass-metallicity
relations. We also measure the N/O abundance ratio, an important tracer
of star formation history, and find the clear signature of primary and
secondary nitrogen enrichment. N/O correlates tightly with oxygen
abundance, and even more so with stellar mass.},

	abstract = {We use the Millennium Simulation, a large, high-resolution N-body
simulation of the evolution of structure in a Λ cold dark matter
cosmology, to study the properties and fate of substructures within a
large sample of dark matter haloes. We find that the subhalo mass
function departs significantly from a power law at the high-mass end. We
also find that the radial and angular distributions of substructures
depend on subhalo mass. In particular, high-mass subhaloes tend to be
less radially concentrated and to have angular distributions closer to
the direction perpendicular to the spin of the host halo than their less
massive counterparts. We find that mergers between subhaloes occur.
These tend to be between substructures that were already dynamically
associated before accretion into the main halo. For subhaloes larger
than 0.001 times the mass of the host halo, it is more likely that the
subhalo will merge with the central or main subhalo than with another
subhalo larger than itself. For lower masses, subhalo-subhalo mergers
become equally likely to mergers with the main subhalo. Our results have
implications for the variation of galaxy properties with environment and
for the treatment of mergers in galaxy formation models.},

	abstract = {Studying how nuclear star clusters (NSCs) form and how they are related to the growth of the central massive black holes (MBHs) and their host galaxies is fundamental for our understanding of the evolution of galaxies and the processes that have shaped their central structures. We present the results of a semi-analytical galaxy formation model that follows the evolution of dark matter halos along merger trees, as well as that of the baryonic components. This model allows us to study the evolution of NSCs in a cosmological context, by taking into account the growth of NSCs due to both dynamical-friction-driven migration of stellar clusters and star formation triggered by infalling gas, while also accounting for dynamical heating from (binary) MBHs. We find that in situ star formation contributes a significant fraction (up to ∼80\%) of the total mass of NSCs in our model. Both NSC growth through in situ star formation and that through star cluster migration are found to generate NSC—host galaxy scaling correlations that are shallower than the same correlations for MBHs. We explore the role of galaxy mergers on the evolution of NSCs and show that observational data on NSC—host galaxy scaling relations provide evidence of partial erosion of NSCs by MBH binaries in luminous galaxies. We show that this observational feature is reproduced by our models, and we make predictions about the NSC and MBH occupation fraction in galaxies. We conclude by discussing several implications for theories of NSC formation.},

This result is more robust to uncertainties in the flow-model corrected redshifts than from the shallower Sloan Digital Sky Survey main sample (r {\textless} 17.8 mag). The upturn in the {GSMF} is also seen directly in the i-band and K-band galaxy luminosity functions.

	abstract = {We study the constraints that high-redshift structure formation in the universe places on warm dark matter {(WDM)} dominated cosmological models. We modify the extended {Press-Schechter} formalism to derive the halo mass function in {WDM} models. We show that our predictions agree with recent numerical simulations at low redshift over the halo masses of interest. Applying our model to galaxy formation at high redshift, we find that the loss of power on small scales, together with the delayed collapse of low-mass objects, results in strong limits on the root-mean-square velocity dispersion vrms,0 of the {WDM} particles at redshift zero. For fermions decoupling while relativistic, these limits are equivalent to constraints on the mass {mX} of the particles. The presence of a {\textasciitilde}4{\texttimes}109 M solar supermassive black hole at redshift 5.8, believed to power the quasar {SDSS} 1044-1215, implies {mX{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.5} {keV} (or vrms,0{\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.10 km s-1), assuming that the quasar is unlensed and radiating at or below the Eddington limit. Reionization by redshift 5.8 also implies a limit on {mX.} If high-redshift galaxies produce ionizing photons with an efficiency similar to their redshift-three counterparts, we find {mX{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1.2} {keV} (or vrms,0{\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.03 s-1). However, given the uncertainties in current measurements from the proximity effect of the ionizing background at redshift three, values of {mX} as low as 0.75 {keV} (or vrms,0=0.06 s-1) are not ruled out. The limit weakens further to {mX{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.4} {keV} (or vrms,0{\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.14 s-1), if, instead, the ionizing-photon production efficiency is 10 times greater at high redshift, but this limit will tighten considerably if reionization is shown in the future to have occurred at higher redshifts. {WDM} models with {mX{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1} {keV} (or vrms,0{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.04 s-1) produce a low-luminosity cutoff in the high-redshift galaxy luminosity function that is directly detectable with the Next Generation Space Telescope, and which serves as a direct constraint on {mX.}},

	abstract = {We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between central galaxies and their host dark matter halos, as characterized by the stellar mass-halo mass {(SM-HM)} relation, with rigorous consideration of uncertainties. Our analysis focuses on results from the abundance matching technique, which assumes that every dark matter halo or subhalo above a specific mass threshold hosts one galaxy. We provide a robust estimate of the {SM-HM} relation for 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1 and discuss the quantitative effects of uncertainties in observed galaxy stellar mass functions (including stellar mass estimates and counting uncertainties), halo mass functions (including cosmology and uncertainties from substructure), and the abundance matching technique used to link galaxies to halos (including scatter in this connection). Our analysis results in a robust estimate of the {SM-HM} relation and its evolution from z = 0 to z = 4. The shape and the evolution are well constrained for z {\textless} 1. The largest uncertainties at these redshifts are due to stellar mass estimates (0.25 dex uncertainty in normalization); however, failure to account for scatter in stellar masses at fixed halo mass can lead to errors of similar magnitude in the {SM-HM} relation for central galaxies in massive halos. We also investigate the {SM-HM} relation to z = 4, although the shape of the relation at higher redshifts remains fairly unconstrained when uncertainties are taken into account. We find that the integrated star formation at a given halo mass peaks at 10\%-20\% of available baryons for all redshifts from 0 to 4. This peak occurs at a halo mass of 7 × 1011 M sun at z = 0 and this mass increases by a factor of 5 to z = 4. At lower and higher masses, star formation is substantially less efficient, with stellar mass scaling as M * {\textasciitilde} M 2.3 h at low masses and M * {\textasciitilde} M 0.29 h at high masses. The typical stellar mass for halos with mass less than 1012 M sun has increased by 0.3-0.45 dex for halos since z {\textasciitilde} 1. These results will provide a powerful tool to inform galaxy evolution models.},

	abstract = {We use a large sample of galaxies from the Two Micron All Sky Survey {(2MASS)} and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey {(SDSS)} to calculate galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions in the local universe. We estimate corrections for passband shifting and galaxy evolution, as well as present-day stellar mass-to-light {(M/L)} ratios, by fitting the optical-near-infrared galaxy data with simple models. Accounting for the 8\% galaxy overdensity in the {SDSS} early data release region, the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions we construct for this sample agree with most recent literature optical and near-infrared determinations within the uncertainties. We argue that {2MASS} is biased against low surface brightness galaxies and use {SDSS} plus our knowledge of stellar populations to estimate the ``true'' K-band luminosity function. This has a steeper faint end slope and a slightly higher overall luminosity density than the direct estimate. Furthermore, assuming a universally applicable stellar initial mass function {(IMF)}, we find good agreement between the stellar mass function we derive from the {2MASS/SDSS} data and that derived by Cole et al. The faint end slope for the stellar mass function is steeper than -1.1, reflecting the low stellar {M/L} ratios characteristic of low-mass galaxies. We estimate an upper limit to the stellar mass density in the local universe Ω*h=2.0+/-0.6×10-3 by assuming an {IMF} as rich in low-mass stars as allowed by observations of galaxy dynamics in the local universe. The stellar mass density may be lower than this value if a different {IMF} with fewer low-mass stars is assumed. Finally, we examine type-dependence in the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions and the stellar mass function. In agreement with previous work, we find that the characteristic luminosity or mass of early-type galaxies is larger than for later types, and the faint end slope is steeper for later types than for earlier types. Accounting for typing uncertainties, we estimate that at least half, and perhaps as much as 3/4, of the stellar mass in the universe is in early-type galaxies. As an aid to workers in the field, we present in an Appendix the relationship between model stellar {M/L} ratios and colors in {SDSS/2MASS} passbands, an updated discussion of near-infrared stellar {M/L} ratio estimates, and the volume-corrected distribution of g- and K-band stellar {M/L} ratios as a function of stellar mass.},

We show that the distribution of radial and tangential velocities has a simple form and provide a fitting formula for this distribution.

We also find (weak) evidence for correlations between the direction of the infall and infall velocity and the spin of the host halo.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009MNRAS.397.1302B},
	abstract = {Unbound outflows in the form of highly collimated jets and broad winds
appear to be a ubiquitous feature of accreting black hole systems. The
most powerful jets are thought to derive a significant fraction, if not
the majority, of their power from the rotational energy of the black
hole. Whatever the precise mechanism that causes them, these jets must,
therefore, exert a braking torque on the black hole. Consequently, we
expect jet production to play a significant role in limiting the maximum
spin attainable by accreting black holes. We calculate the spin-up
function - the rate of change of black hole spin normalized to the black
hole mass and accretion rate - for an accreting black hole, accounting
for this braking torque. We assume that the accretion flow on to a Kerr
black hole is advection-dominated {(ADAF)} and construct easy-to-use
analytic fits to describe the global structure of such flows based on
the numerical solutions of Popham \& Gammie. We find that the
predicted black hole spin-up function depends only on the black hole
spin and dimensionless parameters describing the accretion flow. Using
recent relativistic magnetohydrodynamical {(MHD)} numerical simulation
results to calibrate the efficiency of angular momentum transfer in the
flow, we find that an {ADAF} flow will spin a black hole up (or down) to
an equilibrium value of about 96 per cent of the maximal spin value in
the absence of jets. Combining our {ADAF} system with a simple model for
jet power, we demonstrate that an equilibrium is reached at
approximately 93 per cent of the maximal spin value, as found in the
numerical simulation studies of the spin-up of accreting black holes, at
which point the spin-up of the hole by accreted material is balanced by
the braking torque arising from jet production. The existence of
equilibrium spin means that optically dim active galactic nuclei {(AGNs)}
that have grown via accretion from an advection-dominated flow will not
be maximally rotating. It also offers a possible explanation for the
tight correlation observed by Allen et al. between the Bondi accretion
rate and jet power in nine, nearby, X-ray luminous giant elliptical
galaxies. We suggest that the black holes in these galaxies must all be
rotating close to their equilibrium value. Our model also yields a
relationship between jet efficiency and black hole spin that is in
surprisingly good agreement with that seen in the simulation studies,
indicating that our simple model is a useful and convenient description
of {ADAF} inflow - jet outflow about a spinning black hole for
incorporation in semi-analytic modelling as well as cosmological
numerical simulation studies focusing on the formation and evolution of
galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010arXiv1004.1162B},
	abstract = {A generic expectation for gas accreted by high mass haloes is that it is
shock heated to the virial temperature of the halo. In low mass haloes,
or at high redshift, however, the gas cooling rate is sufficiently rapid
that an accretion shock is unlikely to form. Instead, gas can accrete
directly into the centre of the halo in a `cold mode' of accretion.
Although semi-analytic models have always made a clear distinction
between hydrostatic and rapid cooling they have not made a distinction
between whether or not an accretion shock forms. Starting from the
well-established Galform code, we investigate the effect of explicitly
accounting for cold mode accretion using the shock stability model of
Birnboim \& Dekel. When we modify the code so that there is no
effective feedback from galaxy formation, we find that cold mode
accretion is the dominant channel for feeding gas into the galaxies at
high redshifts. However, this does not translate into a significant
difference in the star formation history of the universe compared to the
previous code. When effective feedback is included in the model, we find
that the the cold mode is much less apparent because of the presence of
gas ejected from the galaxy. Thus the inclusion of the additional cold
mode physics makes little difference to basic results from earlier
semi-analytic models which used a simpler treatment of gas accretion.
For more sophisticated predictions of its consequences, we require a
better understanding of how the cold mode delivers angular momentum to
galaxies and how it interacts with outflows.},

	abstract = {We compare the statistical properties of galaxies found in two different models of hierarchical galaxy formation: the semi-analytic model of Cole et al. and the smoothed particle hydrodynamics {(SPH)} simulations of Pearce et al. These two techniques model gas processes very differently: by approximate, analytic methods in the case of the semi-analytic model, and by direct numerical integration of the equations of hydrodynamics for a set of discrete particles in the case of {SPH.} Using a `stripped-down' version of the semi-analytic model which mimics the resolution of the {SPH} simulations and excludes physical processes not included in them, we find that the two models produce an ensemble of galaxies with remarkably similar properties, although there are some differences in the gas cooling rates and in the number of galaxies that populate haloes of different mass. The full semi-analytic model, which has effectively no resolution limit and includes a treatment of star formation and supernovae feedback, produces somewhat different (but readily understandable) results. Our comparison demonstrates that, on the whole, {SPH} simulations and semi-analytic models give similar results for the thermodynamic evolution of cooling gas in cosmological volumes. Agreement is particularly good for the present-day global fractions of hot gas, cold dense (i.e. galactic) gas and uncollapsed gas, for which the {SPH} and stripped-down semi-analytic calculations differ by at most 25per cent. In the most massive haloes, the stripped-down semi-analytic model predicts, on the whole, up to 50per cent less gas in galaxies than is seen in the {SPH} simulations. The two techniques apportion this cold gas somewhat differently amongst galaxies in a given halo. This difference can be tracked down to the greater cooling rate in massive haloes in the {SPH} simulation compared with the semi-analytic model. The galaxy correlation functions in the two models agree to better than about 50per cent over most pair separations and evolve with redshift in very similar ways. Our comparison demonstrates that these different techniques for modelling galaxy formation produce results that are broadly consistent with each other and highlights areas where further study is required.},

	abstract = {We develop a coupled model for the evolution of the global properties of the intergalactic medium {(IGM)} and the formation of galaxies, in the presence of a photoionizing background due to stars and quasars. We use this model to predict the thermodynamic history of the {IGM} when photoionized by galaxies forming in a cold dark matter {(CDM)} universe. The evolution of the galaxies is calculated using a semi-analytical model, including a detailed treatment of the effects of tidal stripping and dynamical friction on satellite galaxies orbiting inside larger dark matter haloes. We include in the model the negative feedback on galaxy formation from the photoionizing background. Photoionization inhibits galaxy formation in low-mass dark matter haloes in two ways: (i) heating of the {IGM} and inhibition of the collapse of gas into dark haloes by the {IGM} pressure, and (ii) reduction in the rate of radiative cooling of gas within haloes. The result of our method is a self-consistent model of galaxy formation and the {IGM.} The {IGM} is reheated twice (during reionization of {HI} and {HeII),} and we find that the star formation rate per unit volume is slightly suppressed after each episode of reheating. We find that galaxies brighter than L* are mostly unaffected by reionization, while the abundance of faint galaxies is significantly reduced, leading to present-day galaxy luminosity functions with shallow faint-end slopes, in good agreement with recent observational data. Reionization also affects other properties of these faint galaxies, in a readily understandable way.},

	abstract = {We use a self-consistent model of galaxy formation and the evolution of the intergalactic medium to study the effects of the reionization of the Universe at high redshift on the properties of satellite galaxies like those seen around the Milky Way. Photoionization suppresses the formation of small galaxies, so that surviving satellites are preferentially those that formed before the Universe reionized. As a result, the number of satellites expected today is about an order of magnitude smaller than the number inferred by identifying satellites with subhaloes of the same circular velocity in high-resolution simulations of the dark matter. The resulting satellite population has an abundance similar to that observed in the Local Group, although the distribution of circular velocities differs somewhat from the available data. We explore many other properties of satellite galaxies, including their gas content, metallicity and star formation rate, and find generally good agreement with available data. Our model predicts the existence of many as yet undetected satellites in the Local Group. We quantify their observability in terms of their apparent magnitude and surface brightness, and also in terms of their constituent stars. A near-complete census of the Milky Way's satellites would require imaging to V{\textasciitilde}20 and to a surface brightness fainter than 26 V-band magnitudes per square arcsecond. Satellites with integrated luminosity V=15 should contain of order 100 stars brighter than B=26, with central stellar densities of a few tens per square arcminute. Discovery of a large population of faint satellites would provide a strong test of current models of galaxy formation.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...599...38B},
	abstract = {We investigate the physical mechanisms that shape the luminosity function of galaxies in hierarchical clustering models. Beginning with the mass function of dark matter halos in the {LambdaCDM} {(Lambda} cold dark matter) cosmology, we show, in incremental steps, how gas cooling, photoionization at high redshift, feedback processes, galaxy merging, and thermal conduction affect the shape of the luminosity function. We consider three processes whereby supernovae and stellar wind energy can affect the forming galaxy: (1) the reheating of cold disk gas to the halo temperature; (2) expansion of the hot, diffuse halo gas; and (3) complete expulsion of cold disk gas from the halo. We demonstrate that while feedback of form 1 is able to flatten the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function, this process alone does not produce the sharp cutoff observed at large luminosities. Feedback of form 2 is also unable to solve the problem at the bright end of the luminosity function. The relative paucity of very bright galaxies can only be explained if cooling in massive halos is strongly suppressed. This might happen if thermal conduction near the centers of halos is very efficient, or if a substantial amount of gas is expelled from halos by process 3 above. Conduction is a promising mechanism, but an uncomfortably high efficiency is required to suppress cooling to the desired level. If, instead, superwinds are responsible for the lack of bright galaxies, then the total energy budget required to obtain a good match to the galaxy luminosity function greatly exceeds the energy available from supernova explosions. The mechanism is only viable if the formation of central supermassive black holes and the associated energy generation play a crucial role in limiting the amount of stars that form in the host galaxy. The models that best reproduce the galaxy luminosity function also give reasonable approximations to the {Tully-Fisher} relation and the galaxy autocorrelation function.},

	abstract = {Dark matter halo merger trees are now routinely extracted from cosmological simulations of structure formation. These trees are frequently used as inputs to semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to provide the backbone within which galaxy formation takes place. By necessity, these merger trees are constructed from a finite set of discrete 'snapshots' of the N-body simulation and so have a limited temporal resolution. To date, there has been little consideration of how this temporal resolution affects the properties of galaxies formed within these trees. In particular, the question of how many snapshots are needed to achieve convergence in galaxy properties has not be answered. Therefore, we study the convergence in the stellar and total baryonic masses of galaxies, distribution of merger times, stellar mass functions and star formation rates in the {GALACTICUS} model of galaxy formation as a function of the number of 'snapshot' times used to represent dark matter halo merger trees. When utilizing snapshots between z= 20 and 0, we find that at least 128 snapshots are required to achieve convergence to within 5 per cent for galaxy masses, while 64 snapshots give convergence only to within 10 per cent for high-mass haloes. This convergence is obtained for mean quantities averaged over large samples of galaxies - significant variance for individual galaxies remains even when using very large numbers of snapshots. We find only weak dependence of the rate of convergence on the distribution of snapshots in time - snapshots spaced uniformly in the expansion factor, uniformly in the logarithm of expansion factor or uniformly in the logarithm of critical overdensity for collapse work equally well in almost all cases. We provide input parameters to {GALACTICUS} which allow this type of convergence study to be tuned to other simulations and to be carried out for other galaxy properties.},

We further show that this model is in approximate agreement with the correlation of the spin magnitude over time as determined from N-body simulations, while it slightly underpredicts the correlation in the direction of the spin vector measured from the same simulations. This model is useful for predicting spins from merger histories derived from non-N-body sources, thereby circumventing the need for very high resolution simulations to permit accurate
measurements of spins. It may be particularly relevant to modelling systems that accumulate angular momentum from haloes over time (such as galactic discs) - we show that this model makes small but
significant changes in the distribution of galactic disc sizes computed using the GALACTICUS semi-analytic galaxy formation model.},

the most luminous galaxies. We quantify this by comparing the luminosity
and stellar mass functions based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ({SDSS)}
cmodel magnitudes, and
{PyMorph}
single-Sérsic and
Sérsic-exponential fits to the
surface brightness profiles of galaxies in the {SDSS.} The
{PyMorph} fits return more light, so
that the predicted masses are larger than when
cmodel magnitudes are used. As a
result, the total stellar mass density at z ˜ 0.1 is about 1.2
times larger than in our previous analysis of the {SDSS.} The differences
are most pronounced at the massive end, where the measured number
density of objects having M* ≥ 6 × 1011
M⊙ is approximately five times larger. Alternatively, at
number densities of 10-6 Mpc-3, the limiting
stellar mass is two times larger. The differences with respect to fits
by other authors, typically based on
Petrosian-like magnitudes, are even
more dramatic, although some of these differences are due to
sky-subtraction problems, and are sometimes masked by large differences
in the assumed {M*/L} (even after scaling to the same initial
mass function). Our results impact studies of the growth and assembly of
stellar mass in galaxies, and of the relation between stellar and halo
mass, so we provide simple analytic fits to these new luminosity and
stellar mass functions and quantify how they depend on morphology, as
well as the binned counts in electronic format. While these allow one to
quantify the differences which arise because of the assumed light
profile, and we believe our
Sérsic-exponential based
results to be the most realistic of the models we have tested, we
caution that which profile is the most appropriate at the high-mass end
is still debated.},

	abstract = {We investigate the spins and shapes of over a million dark matter haloes identified at z = 0 in the Millennium simulation. Our sample spans halo masses ranging from dwarf galaxies to rich galaxy clusters. The very large dynamic range of this Lambda cold dark matter cosmological simulation enables the distribution of spins and shapes and their variation with halo mass and environment to be characterized with unprecedented precision. We compare results for haloes identified using three different algorithms, and investigate (and remove) biases in the estimate of angular momentum introduced both by the algorithm itself and by numerical effects. We introduce a novel halo definition called the {TREE} halo, based on the branches of the halo merger trees, which is more appropriate for comparison with real astronomical objects than the traditional `friends-of-friends' and `spherical overdensity' {(SO)} algorithms. We find that for this many objects, the traditional lognormal function is no longer an adequate description of the distribution, P(lambda), of the dimensionless spin parameter lambda, and we provide a different function that gives a better fit for {TREE} and {SO} haloes. The variation in spin with halo mass is weak but detectable, although the trend depends strongly on the halo definition used. For the entire population of haloes, we find median values of lambdamed = 0.0367-0.0429, depending on the definition of a halo. The haloes exhibit a range of shapes, with a preference for prolateness over oblateness. More-massive haloes tend to be less spherical and more prolate. We find that the more-spherical haloes have less coherent rotation in the median, and those closest to being spherical have a spin independent of mass (lambdamed {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.033). The most-massive haloes have a spin independent of shape (lambdamed {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.032). The majority of haloes have their angular momentum vector aligned with their minor axis and perpendicular to their major axis. We find a general trend for higher spin haloes to be more clustered, with a stronger effect for more-massive haloes. For galaxy cluster haloes, this can be larger than a factor of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde2.},

The mass distribution of halos, as specified by the halo mass function, is a key input for several cosmological probes.

Discrepancies in the results of simulation campaigns for the halo mass function remain in excess of statistical uncertainties and of roughly the same size as the error limits set by near-future observations; we investigate and discuss some of the reasons for these differences. Quantifying error sources and compensating for them as appropriate, we carry out a high-statistics study of dark matter halos from 67 N-body simulations to investigate the mass function and its evolution for a reference ΛCDM cosmology
and for a set of wCDM cosmologies. For the reference ΛCDM
cosmology (close to WMAP5), we quantify the breaking of universality in the form of the mass function as a function of redshift, finding an evolution of as much as 10\% away from the universal form between redshifts z = 0 and z = 2. For cosmologies very close to this reference we provide a fitting formula to our results for the (evolving)
ΛCDM mass function over a mass range of 6 ×
1011-3 × 1015 M sun to an
estimated accuracy of about 2\%. The set of wCDM cosmologies is taken from the Coyote Universe simulation suite. The mass functions from this suite (which includes a ΛCDM cosmology and others with w {\textasciitilde}= -1)
are described by the fitting formula for the reference ΛCDM case at an accuracy level of 10\%, but with clear systematic deviations. We argue that, as a consequence, fitting formulae based on a universal form for the mass function may have limited utility in high-precision cosmological applications.},

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between star
formation rate surface density, {ΣSFR,} and gas surface
density, Σgas, at sub-kpc resolution in a sample of 18
nearby galaxies. We use high-resolution H I data from The H I Nearby
Galaxy Survey, {CO} data from {HERACLES} and the {BIMA} Survey of Nearby
Galaxies, 24 μm data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, and {UV} data
from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer. We target seven spiral galaxies and
11 late-type/dwarf galaxies and investigate how the star formation law
differs between the H2 dominated centers of spiral galaxies,
their H I dominated outskirts and the H I rich late-type/dwarf galaxies.
We find that a Schmidt-type power law with index N = 1.0 ± 0.2
relates {ΣSFR} and {ΣH2} across our sample
of spiral galaxies, i.e., that H2 forms stars at a constant
efficiency in spirals. The average molecular gas depletion time is {\textasciitilde}2
× 109 years. The range of {ΣH2} over
which we measure this relation is {\textasciitilde}3-50 M sun
pc-2, significantly lower than in starburst
environments. We find the same results when performing a pixel-by-pixel
analysis, averaging in radial bins, or when varying the star formation
tracer used. We interpret the linear relation and constant depletion
time as evidence that stars are forming in giant molecular clouds with
approximately uniform properties and that {ΣH2} may be
more a measure of the filling fraction of giant molecular clouds than
changing conditions in the molecular gas. The relationship between total
gas surface density (Σgas) and {ΣSFR}
varies dramatically among and within spiral galaxies. Most galaxies show
little or no correlation between {ΣHI} and
{ΣSFR.} As a result, the star formation efficiency {(SFE),}
{ΣSFR/Σgas,} varies strongly across our
sample and within individual galaxies. We show that this variation is
systematic and consistent with the {SFE} being set by local environmental
factors: in spirals the {SFE} is a clear function of radius, while the
dwarf galaxies in our sample display {SFEs} similar to those found in the
outer optical disks of the spirals. We attribute the similarity to
common environments (low density, low metallicity, H I dominated) and
argue that shear (which is typically absent in dwarfs) cannot drive the
{SFE.} In addition to a molecular Schmidt law, the other general feature
of our sample is a sharp saturation of H I surface densities at
{ΣHI} ≈ 9 M sun pc-2 in
both the spiral and dwarf galaxies. In the case of the spirals, we
observe gas in excess of this limit to be molecular.},

	abstract = {We investigate the conditions for the existence of an expanding virial shock in the gas falling within a spherical dark matter halo. The shock relies on pressure support by the shock-heated gas behind it. When the radiative cooling is efficient compared with the infall rate, the post-shock gas becomes unstable; it collapses inwards and cannot support the shock. We find for a monatomic gas that the shock is stable when the post-shock pressure and density obey . When expressed in terms of the pre-shock gas properties at radius r it reads as
ρrΛ(T)/u3 {\textless} 0.0126, where ρ is the gas
density, u is the infall velocity and Λ(T) is the cooling
function, with the post-shock temperature T{\textasciitilde}u2. This result is confirmed by hydrodynamical simulations, using an accurate spheri-symmetric Lagrangian code. When the stability analysis is applied in cosmology, we find that a virial shock does not develop in most haloes that form before z{\textasciitilde} 2, and it never forms in haloes less massive than a few 1011 Msolar. In such haloes, the infalling gas is not heated to the virial temperature until it hits the disc, thus avoiding the cooling-dominated quasi-static contraction phase. The direct collapse of the cold gas into the disc should have non-trivial effects on the star formation rate and on outflows. The soft X-ray produced by the shock-heated gas in the disc is expected to ionize the dense disc environment, and the subsequent recombination would result in a high flux of Lα emission. This may explain both the puzzling low flux of soft X-ray background and the Lα emitters observed at high redshift.},

	abstract = {We study the shape of the gas-phase mass-metallicity relation (MZR) of a combined sample of present-day dwarf and high-mass star-forming galaxies using IZI, a Bayesian formalism for measuring chemical abundances presented in a previous publication. We observe a characteristic stellar mass scale at M * ≃ 109.5 M ⊙, above which the inter-stellar medium undergoes a sharp increase in its level of chemical enrichment. In the 106-109.5 M ⊙ range the MZR follows a shallow power law (Z{\textbackslash}propto \{M\}* α ) with slope α = 0.14 ± 0.08. Approaching M * ≃ 109.5 M ⊙ the MZR steepens significantly, showing a slope of α = 0.37 ± 0.08 in the \{10\}9.5\{--\}\{10\}10.5 \{M\}⊙ range, and a flattening toward a constant metallicity at higher stellar masses. This behavior is qualitatively different from results in the literature that show a single power-law MZR toward the low-mass end. We thoroughly explore systematic uncertainties in our measurement, and show that the shape of the MZR is not induced by sample selection, aperture effects, a changing N/O abundance, the adopted methodology to construct the MZR, secondary dependences on star formation activity, or diffuse ionized gas contamination, but rather on differences in the method used to measure abundances. High-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies can qualitatively reproduce our result, and suggest a transition in the ability of galaxies to retain their metals for stellar masses above this threshold. The MZR characteristic mass scale also coincides with a transition in the scale height and clumpiness of cold gas disks, and a typical gas fraction below which the efficiency of star formation feedback for driving outflows is expected to decrease sharply.},

The photometric catalog consists of 693,319 galaxies, {QSOs}, and stars; 343,568 of these have redshift determinations, mostly from the {SDSS.} Excluding areas masked by bright stars, the photometric sample covers 3514 deg2, and the spectroscopic sample covers 2627 deg2 (with about 85\% completeness). Earlier, proprietary versions of this catalog have formed the basis of many {SDSS} investigations of the power spectrum, correlation function, and luminosity function of galaxies. Future releases will follow future public releases of the {SDSS.} The catalog includes matches to the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog and Extended Source Catalog, the {IRAS} Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey, the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies, and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey. We calculate and compile derived quantities from the images and spectra of the galaxies in the catalogs (for example, K-corrections and structural parameters for the galaxies). The {SDSS} catalog presented here is photometrically calibrated in a more consistent way than that distributed by the {SDSS} Data Release 2 Archive Servers and is thus more appropriate for large-scale structure statistics, reducing systematic calibration errors across the sky from {\textasciitilde}2\% to {\textasciitilde}1\%. We include an explicit description of the geometry of the catalog, including all imaging and targeting information as a function of sky position. Finally, we have performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of objects in the catalog in order to flag errors (such as errors in deblending). This catalog is complementary to the {SDSS} Archive Servers in that {NYU-VAGC's} calibration, geometric description, and conveniently small size are specifically designed for studying galaxy properties and large-scale structure statistics using the {SDSS} spectroscopic catalog.

different in high- and low-pressure regimes, defined by whether the gas

Warm dark matter {(WDM)} is a simple modification of {CDM} in which the dark matter particles have initial velocities due either to their having decoupled as thermal relics or to their having been formed via nonequilibrium decay. We investigate the nonlinear gravitational clustering of {WDM} with a high-resolution N-body code and identify a number of distinctive observational signatures. Relative to {CDM}, halo concentrations and core densities are lowered, core radii are increased, and large halos emerge with far fewer low-mass satellites. The number of small halos is suppressed, and those present are formed by ``top-down'' fragmentation of caustics, as part of a ``cosmic web'' connecting massive halos. Few small halos form outside this web. If we identify small halos with dwarf galaxies, then their number, spatial distribution, and formation epoch appear in better agreement with the observations for {WDM} than they are for {CDM.}},

Scenarios such as cold dark matter (CDM), thermal warm dark matter (WDM), and dark acoustic oscillations (DAOs) of various strengths are contained in ETHOS with just two parameters hpeak and kpeak, the amplitude and scale of the first DAO peak. The extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism with a smooth-k filter is able to predict the cut-off in the halo mass function created by the suppression of small-scale power in ETHOS models (controlled by kpeak), as well as the slope at small masses that is dependent on hpeak. Interestingly, we find that DAOs introduce a localized feature in the mass distribution of haloes, resulting in a mass function that is distinct in shape compared to either CDM or WDM. We find that the halo density profiles of all ETHOS models are well described by the NFW profile, with a concentration that is lower than in the CDM case in a way that is regulated by kpeak. We show that the concentration-mass relation for DAO models can be well approximated by the mass assembly model based on the EPS theory, which has been proposed for CDM and WDM elsewhere. Our results can be used to perform inexpensive calculations of the halo mass function and concentration-mass relation within the ETHOS parametrization without the need of N-body simulations.},

	abstract = {We present a method that self-consistently tracks the growth of
supermassive black holes {(BHs)} and the feedback from active galactic
nuclei {(AGN)} in cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations. Our model is a
substantially modified version of the one introduced by Springel, Di
Matteo \& Hernquist implemented in a significantly expanded version
of the {GADGET} {III} code, which contains new prescriptions for star
formation, supernova feedback, radiative cooling and chemodynamics. We
simulate the growth of {BHs} from an initial seed state via
Eddington-limited accretion of the surrounding gas, and via mergers with
other {BHs.} Because cosmological simulations at present lack both the
resolution and the physics to model the multiphase interstellar medium,
they tend to strongly underestimate the {Bondi-Hoyle} accretion rate. To
allow low-mass {BHs} to grow, it is therefore necessary to increase the
predicted {Bondi-Hoyle} rates in star-forming gas by large factors, either
by explicitly multiplying the accretion rate by a numerical correction
factor or by using an unresolved, subgrid model for the gas close to the
{BH.} We explore the physical regimes where the use of such multiplicative
factors is reasonable, and through this introduce a new prescription for
gas accretion by {BHs.} Feedback from {AGN} is modelled by coupling a
fraction of the rest-mass energy of the accreted gas thermally into the
surrounding medium. We describe the implementation as well as the
limitations of the model in detail and motivate all the changes relative
to previous work. We demonstrate how general physical considerations can
be used to choose many of the parameters of the model and demonstrate
that the fiducial model reproduces observational constraints.

We employ a large suite of cosmological simulations, in which the
parameters of the {BH} model are varied away from their fiducial values,
to investigate the robustness of the predictions for the cosmic star
formation history and the redshift zero cosmic {BH} density, {BH} scaling
relations and galaxy-specific star formation rates. We find that the
freedom introduced by the need to increase the predicted accretion rates
by hand, the standard procedure in the literature, is the most
significant source of uncertainty. Our simulations demonstrate that
supermassive {BHs} are able to regulate their growth by releasing a fixed
amount of energy for a given halo mass, independent of the assumed
efficiency of {AGN} feedback, which sets the normalization of the {BH}
scaling relations. Regardless of whether {BH} seeds are initially placed
above or below the {BH} scaling relations, they grow on to the same
scaling relations. {AGN} feedback efficiently suppresses star formation in
high-mass galaxies.},

	abstract = {Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of the stellar mass of bright galaxies was already in place at z {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextgreater 1. This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation because massive haloes are assembled late in the hierarchical clustering process intrinsic to the cold dark matter {(CDM)} cosmology. In this paper, we discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei {(AGN)} is assumed to quench cooling flows in massive haloes. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy luminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the Millennium N-body simulation. The accurate dark matter merger trees and large number of realizations of the galaxy formation process enabled by this simulation result in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of the local galaxy population, we investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and galaxy stellar mass functions. We calculate the volume-averaged star formation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in which this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift z {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde 5 and a star formation rate density which rises at least out to z {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde 2 in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these properties have been cited as evidence for `antihierarchical' galaxy formation, we find that when {AGN} feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally hierarchical {CDM} model provides a very good match to these observations.},

	abstract = {The time-scale for galaxies within merging dark matter haloes to merge with each other is an important ingredient in galaxy formation models. Accurate estimates of merging time-scales are required for predictions of astrophysical quantities such as black hole binary merger rates, the build-up of stellar mass in central galaxies and the statistical properties of satellite galaxies within dark matter haloes. In this paper, we study the merging time-scales of extended dark matter haloes using N-body simulations. We compare these results to standard estimates based on the Chandrasekhar theory of dynamical friction. We find that these standard predictions for merging time-scales, which are often used in semi-analytic galaxy formation models, are systematically shorter than those found in simulations. The discrepancy is approximately a factor of 1.7 for {Msat/Mhost} {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.1 and becomes larger for more disparate satellite-to-host mass ratios, reaching a factor of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde3.3 for {Msat/Mhost} {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.01. Based on our simulations, we propose a new, easily implementable fitting formula that accurately predicts the time-scale for an extended satellite to sink from the virial radius of a host halo down to the halo's centre for a wide range of {Msat/Mhost} and orbits. Including a central bulge in each galaxy changes the merging time-scale by {\textbackslash}textless{\textbackslash}textasciitilde10 per cent. To highlight one concrete application of our results, we show that merging time-scales often used in the literature overestimate the growth of stellar mass by satellite accretion by {\textbackslash}textasciitilde40 per cent, with the extra mass gained in low mass ratio mergers.},

	abstract = {It is well established from cosmological simulations that dark matter (DM) haloes are not precisely self-similar and an additional parameter, beyond their concentration, is required to accurately describe their spherically averaged mass density profiles. We present, for the first time, a model to consistently predict both halo concentration, c, and this additional 'shape' parameter, α, for a halo of given mass and redshift for a specified cosmology. Following recent studies, we recast the dependence on mass, redshift, and cosmology to a dependence on 'peak height'. We show that, when adopting the standard definition of peak height, which employs the so-called spherical top hat (STH) window function, the concentration-peak height relation has a strong residual dependence on cosmology (i.e. it is not uniquely determined by peak height), whereas the α-peak height relation is approximately universal when employing the STH window function. Given the freedom in the choice of window function, we explore a simple modification of the STH function, constraining its form so that it produces universal relations for concentration and α as a function of peak height using a large suite of cosmological simulations. It is found that universal relations for the two density profile parameters can indeed be derived and that these parameters are set by the linear power spectrum, P(k), filtered on different scales. We show that the results of this work generalize to any (reasonable) combination of P(k) and background expansion history, H(\$z\$), resulting in accurate predictions of the density profiles of DM haloes for a wide range of cosmologies.},

	abstract = {We compare the results of Eulerian hydrodynamic simulations of cluster
formation against virial scaling relations between four bulk quantities:
the cluster mass, the dark matter velocity dispersion, the gas
temperature, and the cluster luminosity. The comparison is made for a
large number of clusters at a range of redshifts in three different
cosmological models (cold plus hot dark matter, cold dark matter, and
open cold dark matter). We find that the analytic formulae provide a
good description of the relations between three of the four numerical
quantities. The fourth (luminosity) also agrees once we introduce a
procedure to correct for the fixed numerical resolution. We also compute
the normalizations for the virial relations and compare extensively to
the existing literature, finding remarkably good agreement. The
{Press-Schechter} prescription is calibrated with the simulations, again
finding results consistent with other authors. We also examine related
issues such as the size of the scatter in the virial relations, the
effect of metallicity with a fixed passband, and the structure of the
halos. All of this is done in order to establish a firm groundwork for
the use of clusters as cosmological probes. Implications for the models
are briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar
populations at ages between 1 × 105 and 2 ×
1010 yr at a resolution of 3 Å across the whole
wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 Å for a wide range of
metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library
of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution
across a larger wavelength range, from 91 Å to 160 μm, at lower
resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution
theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally
pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by
observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar
populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed
optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star
clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in
the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for
the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the
Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra
from the Early Data Release {(EDR)} of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
{(SDSS).} We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain
physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and
dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate
studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over
the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the {SDSS}
{EDR,} we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed
strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element
abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model
should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation
histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

simulation of a {ΛCDM} cosmology. Our statistical sample contains
{\textasciitilde}5000 haloes in the range
{1011-1014h-1Msolar,} and the
resolution allows a study of subhaloes inside host haloes. The profiles
are parametrized by an {NFW} form with two parameters, an inner radius
rs and a virial radius Rvir, and we define the
halo concentration {cvir≡Rvirrs.}
First, we find that, for a given halo mass, the redshift dependence of
the median concentration is cvir{\textasciitilde}(1+z)-1. This
corresponds to rs(z){\textasciitilde}constant, and is contrary to earlier
suspicions that cvir does not vary much with redshift. The
implications are that high-redshift galaxies are predicted to be more
extended and dimmer than expected before. Secondly, we find that the
scatter in halo profiles is large, with a 1σ
Δ(logcvir)=0.18 at a given mass, corresponding to a
scatter in maximum rotation velocities of
{ΔVmaxVmax=0.12.} We discuss implications for
modelling the {Tully-Fisher} relation, which has a smaller reported
intrinsic scatter. Thirdly, subhaloes and haloes in dense environments
tend to be more concentrated than isolated haloes, and show a larger
scatter. These results suggest that cvir is an essential
parameter for the theory of galaxy modelling, and we briefly discuss
implications for the universality of the {Tully-Fisher} relation, the
formation of low surface brightness galaxies, and the origin of the
Hubble sequence. We present an improved analytic treatment of halo
formation that fits the measured relations between halo parameters and
their redshift dependence, and can thus serve semi-analytic studies of
galaxy formation.},

Cosmological simulations with nonbaryonic dark matter, however, predict self-similar halos with central density cusps. This contradiction has lead to the conclusion that dark matter must be baryonic. Here it is shown that the dark matter halos of dwarf spiral galaxies represent a one-parameter family with self-similar density profiles. The observed global halo parameters are coupled with each other through simple scaling relations which can be explained by the standard cold dark matter model if one assumes that all the halos formed from density fluctuations with the same primordial amplitude. We find that the finite central halo densities correlate with the other global parameters. This result rules out scenarios where the flat halo cores formed subsequently through violent dynamical processes in the baryonic component. These cores instead provide important information on the origin and nature of dark matter in dwarf galaxies.},

Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with {IRAS} archival photometry, to model the dust emission at lambda{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}40
mum. The {FIR} spectral energy distributions ({SEDs}) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T{\textasciitilde}40-55 K (warm dust) and T{\textasciitilde}20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index ε=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the {FIR} emission of
starburst galaxies, representing up to 60\% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to {\textasciitilde}150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust {FIR} emission in the range 1-1000 mum and the {IRAS} {FIR} emission in the range 40-120 mum is {\textasciitilde}1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40\% larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as ``{UV} bright,'' for four of them the {UV} energy emerging shortward of 0.2 mum is less than 15\% of the {FIR} energy. On average, about 30\% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the
{UV}-to-near-{IR} wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the {FIR}. Energy balance calculations show that the {FIR} emission predicted by the dust reddening of the {UV}-to-near-{IR} stellar emission is within a factor of {\textasciitilde}2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20\% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1), {UV}-bright, star-forming
galaxies, these galaxies' {FIR} emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous {FIR} galaxies and (2) their {FIR} {SED} contains a cool dust component.

	abstract = {We report the first results from the evolution of generic black hole binaries, i.e., binaries containing unequal-mass black holes with misaligned spins. Our configuration, which has a mass ratio of 2:1, consists of an initially nonspinning hole orbiting a larger, rapidly spinning hole (specific spin a/m=0.885), with the spin direction oriented -45° with respect to the orbital plane. We track the inspiral and merger for {\textasciitilde}2 orbits and find that the remnant receives a substantial kick of 454 km s-1, more than twice as large as the maximum kick from nonspinning binaries. The remnant spin direction is flipped by 103° with respect to the initial spin direction of the larger hole. We performed a second run with antialigned spins, a/m=+/-0.5 lying in the orbital plane that produces a kick of {\textasciitilde}1830 km s-1 off the orbital plane. This value scales to nearly 4000 km s-1 for maximally spinning holes. Such a large recoil velocity opens up the possibility that a merged binary can be ejected even from the nucleus of a massive host galaxy.},

We construct the anisotropy diagram, which relates the ratio of the ordered and random motion in a galaxy (V/σ) to its observed ellipticity (ɛ), for the 48
{E/S0} galaxies from the {SAURON} survey. For a subsample of 24 galaxies consistent with axisymmetry, we use three-integral axisymmetric Schwarzschild dynamical models to recover the detailed orbital distribution, and we find good agreement with the anisotropy derived from the (V/σ, ɛ) diagram. In a companion paper (Paper
{IX)}, we show that the early-type galaxies can be subdivided into two classes of systems with or without a significant amount of specific stellar angular momentum. Here, we show that the two classes have different distributions on the (V/σ, ɛ) diagram. The slow
rotators are more common among the most massive systems and are generally classified as E from photometry alone. Those in our sample tend to be fairly round (ɛ {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.3), but can have significant kinematical misalignments, indicating that as a class they are moderately triaxial, and span a range of anisotropies (δ {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.3). The fast rotators are generally fainter and are classified as either E or S0. They can appear quite flattened (ɛ {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.7), do not show significant kinematical misalignments (unless barred or interacting), indicating they are nearly axisymmetric and span an even larger range of anisotropies (δ {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 0.5). These results are
confirmed when we extend our analysis to 18 additional {E/S0} galaxies observed with {SAURON.} The dynamical models indicate that the anisotropy inferred from the (V/σ, ɛ) diagram is due to a flattening
of the velocity ellipsoid in the meridional plane ({σR} {\textgreater} σz), which we quantify with the β anisotropy
parameter. We find a trend of increasing β for intrinsically flatter galaxies. A number of the fast rotators show evidence for containing a flattened, kinematically distinct component, which in some cases counter-rotates relative to the main galaxy body. These components are generally more metal rich than the galaxy body. All these results support the idea that fast rotators are nearly oblate and contain disc-like components. The role of gas must have been important for their formation. The slow rotators are weakly triaxial. Current collisionless merger models seem unable to explain their detailed observed properties.},

This effective window Weff is particularly simple in Fourier space, and has an analytic form in real space. Together with the excursion set bias parameters, Weff describes the
scale-dependence of the Lagrangian halo-matter cross correlation up to k RLag˜10 , where RLag is the Lagrangian size of the protohalo. Moreover, with this Weff, all the spectral moments of the power spectrum are finite, allowing a straightforward estimate of the excursion set peak mass function. This estimate requires a prescription of the critical overdensity enclosed within a protohalo if it is to collapse, which we calibrate from simulations. We find that the resulting estimate of halo abundances is only accurate to about 20\%, and we discuss why: a top hat in "infall time" towards the protohalo center need not correspond to a top hat in the initial spatial
distribution, so models in which infall rather than smoothed overdensity is the relevant variable may be more accurate.},

	abstract = {We present a new model for computing the effects of dust on the integrated spectral properties of galaxies, based on an idealized description of the main features of the interstellar medium {(ISM).} The model includes the ionization of H {II} regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the influence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of radiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of continuum radiation in the H {II} regions and the subsequent transfer of line and continuum radiation in the surrounding H I regions and the ambient {ISM.} This enables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of an ultraviolet-selected sample of nearby starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities, the ratio of Hα to Hβ luminosities, the Hα equivalent width, and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime of stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient for resolving an apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In addition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to λ-0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow wavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the steepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In particular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical depths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation of all the observations. A noteworthy outcome of our detailed analysis is that the observed mean relations for starburst galaxies can be closely approximated by the following simple recipe: use an effective absorption curve proportional to λ-0.7 to attenuate the line and continuum radiation from each stellar generation, and lower the normalization of the curve, typically by a factor of 3 after 107 yr, to account for the dispersal of the birth clouds. This recipe or our full model for absorption can be incorporated easily into any population synthesis model.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...699...89C},
	abstract = {The importance of the radiative feedback from massive black holes at the
centers of elliptical galaxies is not in doubt, given the
well-established relations among electromagnetic output, black hole
mass, and galaxy optical luminosity. In addition, feedback due to
mechanical and thermal deposition of energy from jets and winds emitted
by the accretion disk around the central black hole is also expected to
occur and has been included in the work of several investigators. In
this paper, we improve and extend the accretion and feedback physics
explored in our previous papers to include also a physically motivated
model of mechanical feedback, in addition to radiative effects. In
particular, we study the evolution of an isolated elliptical galaxy with
the aid of a high-resolution one-dimensional hydrodynamical code, where
the cooling and heating functions include photoionization and Compton
effects, and restricting to models which include only radiative or only
mechanical feedback (in the form of nuclear winds). We confirm that for
Eddington ratios above 0.01 both the accretion and radiative output are
forced by feedback effects to be in burst mode, so that strong
intermittencies are expected at early times, while at low redshift the
explored models are characterized by smooth, very {sub-Eddington} mass
accretion rates punctuated by rare outbursts. However, the explored
models always fail some observational tests. If we assume the high
mechanical efficiency of 10-2.3 adopted by some
investigators, we find that most of the gas is ejected from the galaxy,
the resulting X-ray luminosity is far less than is typically observed
and little supermassive black hole {(SMBH)} growth occurs. But models with
low enough mechanical efficiency to accommodate satisfactory {SMBH} growth
tend to allow too strong cooling flows and leave galaxies at z = 0 with
{E+A} spectra more frequently than is observed. In a surprising
conclusion, we find that both types of feedback are required. Radiative
heating over the inner few kiloparsecs is needed to prevent calamitous
cooling flows, and mechanical feedback from active galactic nucleus
winds, which affects primarily the inner few hundred parsecs, is needed
to moderate the luminosity and growth of the central {SMBH.} Models with
combined feedback are explored in a forthcoming paper.},

	abstract = {We describe the {GALFORM} semi-analytic model for calculating the formation and evolution of galaxies in hierarchical clustering cosmologies. It improves upon, and extends, the earlier scheme developed by Cole et al. The model employs a new Monte Carlo algorithm to follow the merging evolution of dark matter haloes with arbitrary mass resolution. It incorporates realistic descriptions of the density profiles of dark matter haloes and the gas they contain; it follows the chemical evolution of gas and stars, and the associated production of dust; and it includes a detailed calculation of the sizes of discs and spheroids. Wherever possible, our prescriptions for modelling individual physical processes are based on results of numerical simulations. They require a number of adjustable parameters, which we fix by reference to a small subset of local galaxy data. This results in a fully specified model of galaxy formation which can be tested against other data. We apply our methods to the {LambdaCDM} cosmology {f12(M1,M2)} {dM1} [1/√2pi] [(deltac1 - deltac2)/ (sigma21 - sigma22)3/2] x exp [-(deltac1 - deltac2)2/ 2(sigma22)] {[dsigma21/dM1]} d M1 {(Omega0=0.3)} (df12)/(dt1 t1t2) {dM1} dt1 [1/√(2pi)] [1 / sigma21 - sigma22)3/2] [ddeltac1/dt1] {[dsigma21/dM1]} {dM1} dt1 Lambda0=0.7),-{\textbackslash}textgreater and find good agreement with a wide range of properties of the local galaxy population: the B- and K-band luminosity functions, the distribution of colours for the population as a whole, the ratio of ellipticals to spirals, the distribution of disc sizes, and the current cold gas content of discs. In spite of the overall success of the model, some interesting discrepancies remain: the colour-magnitude relation for ellipticals in clusters is significantly flatter than observed at bright magnitudes (although the scatter is about right), and the model predicts galaxy circular velocities, at a given luminosity, that are about 30per cent larger than is observed. It is unclear whether these discrepancies represent fundamental shortcomings of the model, or whether they result from the various approximations and uncertainties inherent in the technique.

Survey {(2dFGRS),} employing a direct Fourier method. The sample used
comprises 221414 galaxies with measured redshifts. We investigate in
detail the modelling of the sample selection, improving on previous
treatments in a number of respects. A new angular mask is derived, based
on revisions to the photometric calibration. The redshift selection
function is determined by dividing the survey according to rest-frame
colour, and deducing a self-consistent treatment of k-corrections and
evolution for each population. The covariance matrix for the
power-spectrum estimates is determined using two different approaches to
the construction of mock surveys, which are used to demonstrate that the
input cosmological model can be correctly recovered. We discuss in
detail the possible differences between the galaxy and mass power
spectra, and treat these using simulations, analytic models and a hybrid
empirical approach. Based on these investigations, we are confident that
the {2dFGRS} power spectrum can be used to infer the matter content of the
universe. On large scales, our estimated power spectrum shows evidence
for the `baryon oscillations' that are predicted in cold dark matter
{(CDM)} models. Fitting to a {CDM} model, assuming a primordial
ns= 1 spectrum, h= 0.72 and negligible neutrino mass, the
preferred parameters are Ωmh= 0.168 +/- 0.016 and a
baryon fraction Ωb/Ωm= 0.185 +/- 0.046
(1σ errors). The value of Ωmh is 1σ lower
than the 0.20 +/- 0.03 in our 2001 analysis of the partially complete
{2dFGRS.} This shift is largely due to the signal from the newly sampled
regions of space, rather than the refinements in the treatment of
observational selection. This analysis therefore implies a density
significantly below the standard Ωm= 0.3: in

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...699..486C},
	abstract = {The stellar masses, mean ages, metallicities, and star formation
histories of galaxies are now commonly estimated via stellar population
synthesis {(SPS)} techniques. {SPS} relies on stellar evolution calculations
from the main sequence to stellar death, stellar spectral libraries,
phenomenological dust models, and stellar initial mass functions {(IMFs)}
to translate the evolution of a multimetallicity, multi-age set of stars
into a prediction for the time-evolution of the integrated light from
that set of stars. Each of these necessary inputs carries significant
uncertainties that have until now received little systematic attention.
The present work is the first in a series that explores the impact of
uncertainties in key phases of stellar evolution and the {IMF} on the
derived physical properties of galaxies and the expected luminosity
evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. A Monte Carlo Markov
Chain approach is taken to fit {near-UV} through {near-IR} photometry of a
representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies with this new
{SPS} model. Significant results include the following. (1) Including
uncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z {\textasciitilde} 0 carry errors
of {\textasciitilde}0.3 dex at 95\% {CL} with little dependence on luminosity or color,
while at z {\textasciitilde} 2, the masses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the
{\textasciitilde}0.6 dex level. (2) Either current stellar evolution models, current
observational stellar libraries, or both, do not adequately characterize
the metallicity-dependence of the thermally pulsating {AGB} phase. (3)
Conservative estimates on the uncertainty of the slope of the {IMF} in the
solar neighborhood imply that luminosity evolution per unit redshift is
uncertain at the {\textasciitilde}0.4 mag level in the K band, which is a substantial
source of uncertainty for interpreting the evolution of galaxy
populations across time. Any possible evolution in the {IMF,} as suggested
by several independent lines of evidence, will only exacerbate this
problem. (4) Assuming a distribution of stellar metallicities within a
galaxy, rather than a fixed value as is usually assumed, can yield
important differences when considering bands blueward of V, but is not a
concern for redder bands. Spectroscopic information may alleviate some
of these concerns, though uncertainties in the stellar spectral
libraries and the importance of nonsolar abundance ratios have not yet
been systematically investigated in the {SPS} context.},

a viable mechanism for the production of elliptical galaxies, then merging must be
capable of producing these scaling relations. Previous studies have suggested that it is
diﬃcult to produce the observed slope and scatter of the early-type size-mass relation

produced by two semi-analytical models, in order to derive scaling relations of merger
remnants. Importantly, our model includes the eﬀects of gaseous energy dissipation

	abstract = {Feedback from supernovae is an essential aspect of galaxy formation. In order to improve subgrid models of feedback, we perform a series of numerical experiments to investigate how supernova explosions shape the interstellar medium (ISM) in a disc galaxy and power a galactic wind. We use the FLASH hydrodynamic code to model a simplified ISM, including gravity, hydrodynamics, radiative cooling above 104 K and star formation that reproduces the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. By simulating a small patch of the ISM in a tall box perpendicular to the disc, we obtain subparsec resolution allowing us to resolve individual supernova events. The hot interiors of supernova explosions combine into larger bubbles that sweep-up the initially hydrostatic ISM into a dense, warm cloudy medium, enveloped by a much hotter and tenuous medium, all phases in near pressure equilibrium. The unbound hot phase develops into an outflow with wind speed increasing with distance as it accelerates from the disc. We follow the launch region of the galactic wind, where hot gas entrains and ablates warm ISM clouds leading to significantly increased mass loading of the flow, although we do not follow this material as it interacts with the galactic halo.

We run a large grid of simulations in which we vary gas surface density, gas fraction and star formation rate in order to investigate the dependencies of the mass loading, β equiv dot\{M\}\_wind/dot\{M\}\_star. In the cases with the most effective outflows, we observe β = 4; however, in other cases we find β ≪ 1. We find that outflows are more efficient in discs with lower surface densities or gas fractions. A simple model in which the warm cloudy medium is the barrier that limits the expansion of the blast wave reproduces the scaling of outflow properties with disc parameters at high star formation rates. We extend the scaling relations derived from an ISM patch to infer an effective mass loading for a galaxy with an exponential disc, finding that the mass loading depends on circular velocity as β∝V-
αd with α ≈ 2.5 for a model which fits
the Tully-Fisher relation. Such a scaling is often assumed in
phenomenological models of galactic winds in order to reproduce the flat faint end slope of the mass function. Our normalization is in
approximate agreement with observed estimates of the mass loading for the Milky Way. The scaling we find sets the investigation of galaxy winds on a new footing, providing a physically motivated subgrid description of winds that can be implemented in cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations and phenomenological models.},

In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to be successful.},

primordial 7Li abundance as predicted by big bang
nucleosynthesis (BBN) theory and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe (WMAP) baryon density, and the pre-Galactic lithium abundance
inferred from observations of metal-poor (Population II) stars. This
problem has loomed for the past decade, with a persistent discrepancy of
a factor of 2-3 in 7Li/H. Recent developments have sharpened
all aspects of the Li problem. Namely: (1) BBN theory predictions have
sharpened due to new nuclear data; in particular, the uncertainty on the
reaction rate for3He(α,γ)7Be has
reduced to 7.4\%, nearly a factor of 2 tighter than previous
determinations. (2) The WMAP five-year data set now yields a cosmic
baryon density with an uncertainty reduced to 2.7\%. (3) Observations of
metal-poor stars have tested for systematic effects. With these, we now
find that the BBN+WMAP predicts7Li/H =
(5.24-0.67+0.71) × 10-10. The
central value represents an increase by 23\%, most of which is due to the
upward shift in the3He(α,γ)7Be rate.
More significant is the reduction in the7Li/H uncertainty by
almost a factor of 2, tracking the reduction in
the3He(α,γ)7Be error bar. These
changes exacerbate the Li problem; the discrepancy is now a factor 2.4
or 4.2σ (from globular cluster stars) to 4.3 or 5.3σ (from
halo field stars). Possible resolutions to the lithium problem are
briefly reviewed, and key experimental and astronomical measurements
highlighted.},

enables cosmological structure formation to be computed in almost any
microphysical model of dark matter physics. This framework maps the
detailed microphysical theories of particle dark matter interactions
into the physical effective parameters that shape the linear matter
power spectrum and the self-interaction transfer cross section of
nonrelativistic dark matter. These are the input to structure formation
simulations, which follow the evolution of the cosmological and galactic
dark matter distributions. Models with similar effective parameters in
ETHOS but with different dark particle physics would nevertheless result
in similar dark matter distributions. We present a general method to map
an ultraviolet complete or effective field theory of low-energy dark
matter physics into parameters that affect the linear matter power
spectrum and carry out this mapping for several representative particle
models. We further propose a simple but useful choice for characterizing
the dark matter self-interaction transfer cross section that
parametrizes self-scattering in structure formation simulations. Taken
together, these effective parameters in ETHOS allow the classification
of dark matter theories according to their structure formation
properties rather than their intrinsic particle properties, paving the
way for future simulations to span the space of viable dark matter
physics relevant for structure formation.},

depth, {VIPERS} provides a detailed picture of the galaxy distribution at
z ≃ 0.8, when the Universe was ≃7 Gyr old. We carefully
estimate the uncertainties and systematic effects associated with the
{SED} fitting procedure used to derive galaxy stellar masses. We estimate
the galaxy stellar mass function at several epochs between z = 0.5 and
1.3, discussing the amount of cosmic variance affecting our estimate in
detail. We find that Poisson noise and cosmic variance of the galaxy
mass function in the {VIPERS} survey are comparable to the statistical
uncertainties of large surveys in the local universe. {VIPERS} data allow
us to determine with unprecedented accuracy the high-mass tail of the
galaxy stellar mass function, which includes a significant number of
galaxies that are too rare to detect with any of the past spectroscopic
surveys. At the epochs sampled by {VIPERS}, massive galaxies had already
assembled most of their stellar mass. We compare our results with both
previous observations and theoretical models. We apply a photometric
classification in the (U - V) rest-frame colour to compute the mass
function of blue and red galaxies, finding evidence for the evolution of
their contribution to the total number density budget: the transition
mass above which red galaxies dominate is found to be about
1010.4 ℳ⊙ at z ≃ 0.55, and it
evolves proportionally to (1 + z)3. We are able to separately
trace the evolution of the number density of blue and red galaxies with
masses above 1011.4 ℳ⊙, in a mass range
barely studied in previous work. We find that for such high masses, red
galaxies show a milder evolution with redshift, when compared to objects
at lower masses. At the same time, we detect a population of similarly
massive blue galaxies, which are no longer detectable below z = 0.7.
These results show the improved statistical power of {VIPERS} data, and
give initial promising indications of mass-dependent quenching of
galaxies at z ≃ 1.

	abstract = {We investigate the dependence of the local space density of spiral
galaxies on luminosity, scale size, and surface brightness. We derive
bivariate space density distributions in these quantities from a sample
of about 1000 {Sb-Sdm} spiral galaxies, corrected for selection effects in
luminosity and surface brightness. The structural parameters of the
galaxies were corrected for internal extinction using a description
depending on galaxy surface brightness. We find that the bivariate space
density distribution of spiral galaxies in the (luminosity, scale
size)-plane is well described by a Schechter luminosity function in the
luminosity dimension and a log-normal scale-size distribution at a given
luminosity. This parameterization of the scale-size distribution was
motivated by a simple model for the formation of disks within dark
matter halos, with halos acquiring their angular momenta through tidal
torques from neighboring objects and the disk specific angular momentum
being proportional to that of the parent halo. However, the fractional
width of the scale-size distribution at a given luminosity is narrower
than what one would expect from using the distribution of angular
momenta of halos measured in N-body simulations of hierarchical
clustering. We present several possible explanations for the narrowness
of the observed distribution. Using our bivariate distribution, we find
that determinations of the local luminosity function of spiral galaxies
should not be strongly affected by the bias against low surface
brightness galaxies, even when the galaxies are selected from
photographic plates. This may not be true for studies at high redshift,
where (1+z)4 surface brightness dimming would cause a
significant selection bias against lower surface brightness galaxies, if
the galaxy population did not evolve with redshift.},

	abstract = {We use semi-analytic techniques to study the formation and evolution of brightest cluster galaxies ({BCGs).} We show the extreme hierarchical nature of these objects and discuss the limitations of simple ways to capture their evolution. In a model where cooling flows are suppressed at late times by active galactic nucleus ({AGN)} activity, the stars of {BCGs} are formed very early (50 per cent at z {\textasciitilde} 5, 80 per cent at z {\textasciitilde} 3) and in many small galaxies. The high star formation rates in these high-z progenitors are fuelled by rapid cooling, not by merger-triggered starbursts. We find that model {BCGs} assemble surprisingly late: half their final mass is typically locked up in a single galaxy after z {\textasciitilde} 0.5. Because most of the galaxies accreted on to {BCGs} have little gas content and red colours, late mergers do not change the apparent age of {BCGs.} It is this accumulation of a large number of old stellar populations - driven mainly by the merging history of the dark matter halo itself - that yields the observed homogeneity of {BCG} properties. In the second part of the paper, we discuss the evolution of {BCGs} to high redshifts, from both observational and theoretical viewpoints. We show that our model {BCGs} are in qualitative agreement with high-z observations. We discuss the hierarchical link between high-z {BCGs} and their local counterparts. We show that high-z {BCGs} belong to the same population as the massive end of local {BCG} progenitors, although they are not in general the same galaxies. Similarly, high-z {BCGs} end up as massive galaxies in the local Universe, although only a fraction of them are actually {BCGs} of massive clusters.},

In this work, we provide a framework to predict for each halo the coefficient \$A\$ of its central cusp. We also present a "cusp-NFW" functional form that accurately describes the density profile of a halo with a prompt cusp at its center. Accurate characterization of each halo's central cusp is of particular importance in the study of warm dark matter models, for which the spectral cutoff is on an astrophysically relevant mass scale. To facilitate easy incorporation of prompt cusps into any halo modeling approach, we provide a code package that implements the cusp-halo relation and the cusp-NFW density profile.},

Navarro-Frenk-White and Einasto profiles, at radii r {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 0.5R
200m. In particular, at these radii the logarithmic slope of the median density profiles of massive or rapidly accreting halos steepens more sharply than predicted. The steepest slope of the profiles occurs at r ≈ R 200m, and its absolute value increases with increasing peak height or mass accretion rate, reaching slopes of -4 and steeper. Importantly, we find that the outermost density profiles at r {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} R 200m are remarkably self-similar when radii are rescaled by R 200m. This self-similarity indicates that radii defined with respect to the mean density are preferred for describing the structure and evolution of the outer profiles. However, the inner density profiles are most self-similar when radii are rescaled by R 200c. We propose a new fitting formula that describes the median and mean profiles of halo samples selected by their peak height or mass accretion rate with accuracy {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 10\% at all radii, redshifts, and masses we studied, r {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 9R vir, 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 6, and M

While numerous models for this relation have been proposed, almost none of them attempt to derive the evolution of the relation analytically. We build on previous efforts to model the c-M relation as a function of physical parameters such as the peak height, , and the effective power spectrum slope, \{n\vphantom{\{}\}eff\}, which capture the dependence of c on halo mass, redshift, and cosmology. We present three major improvements over previous models. First, we derive an analytical expression for the c-M relation that is valid under the assumption of pseudo-evolution, i.e., assuming that the density profiles of halos are static in physical coordinates while the definition of their boundary evolves. We find that this ansatz is highly successful in describing the evolution of the low-mass end of the c-M relation. Second, we employ a new physical variable, the effective exponent of linear growth, \{ \vphantom{\{}\}eff\}, to parameterize deviations
from an Einstein-de Sitter expansion history. Third, we combine an updated definition of \{n\vphantom{\{}\}eff\} with the additional dependence on \{ \vphantom{\{}\}eff\} and propose a phenomenological extension of our analytical framework to include all halo masses. This semianalytical model matches simulated concentrations in both scale-free models and DM to 5\% accuracy with very few exceptions and differs
significantly from all previously proposed models. We present a publicly available code to compute the predictions of our model in the python toolkit COLOSSUS, including updated parameters for the model of Diemer and Kravtsov.},

The target catalogue constitutes three contiguous equatorial regions centred at 9h (G09), 12h (G12) and 14.5h (G15) each of 12 × 4 deg2 to limiting fluxes of
rpet {\textless} 19.4, rpet {\textless} 19.8 and rpet {\textless} 19.4 mag, respectively (and additional limits at other
wavelengths). Spectra and reliable redshifts have been acquired for over 98 per cent of the galaxies within these limits. Here we present the survey footprint, progression, data reduction, redshifting,
re-redshifting, an assessment of data quality after 3 yr, additional image analysis products (including {ugrizYJHK} photometry, Sérsic
profiles and photometric redshifts), observing mask and construction of our core survey catalogue ({GamaCore).} From this we create three
science-ready catalogues: {GamaCoreDR1} for public release, which includes data acquired during year 1 of operations within specified magnitude limits (2008 February to April); {GamaCoreMainSurvey} containing all data above our survey limits for use by the {GAMA} Team and collaborators; and {GamaCoreAtlasSV} containing year 1, 2 and 3 data matched to
Herschel-{ATLAS} science demonstration data. These catalogues along with the associated spectra, stamps and profiles can be accessed via the {GAMA} website:},

	abstract = {We derive the halo mass function (HMF) for fuzzy dark matter (FDM) by solving the excursion set problem explicitly with a mass-dependent barrier function, which has not been done before. We find that compared to the naive approach of the Sheth-Tormen HMF for FDM, our approach has a higher cutoff mass and the cutoff mass changes less strongly with redshifts. Using merger trees constructed with a modified version of the Lacey \& Cole formalism that accounts for suppressed small-scale
power and the scale-dependent growth of FDM haloes and the semi-analytic GALACTICUS code, we study the statistics of halo substructure including the effects from dynamical friction and tidal stripping. We find that if the dark matter is a mixture of cold dark matter (CDM) and FDM, there will be a suppression on the halo substructure on small scales which may be able to solve the missing satellites problem faced by the pure CDM model. The suppression becomes stronger with increasing FDM fraction or decreasing FDM mass. Thus, it may be used to constrain the FDM model.},

In order to compare observations with dark matter models, accurate theoretical predictions of these quantities are needed. We present a fast and accurate method to describe the tidal evolution of subhalos within their parent halo, based on a semianalytic approach. We first consider idealized N -body simulations of subhalos within their host halo, using a generalized mass density profile that describes their properties in a variety of dark matter models at infall, including popular warm, cold, and self-interacting ones. Using these simulations we construct tidal "tracks" for the evolution of subhalos based on their conditions at infall. Second, we use the results of these simulations to build semianalytic models for tidal effects, including stripping and heating and implement them within the code GALACTICUS. Our semianalytic models can accurately predict the tidal evolution of both cored and cuspy subhalos, including the bound mass and density profiles, providing a powerful and efficient tool for studying the postinfall properties of subhalos in different dark matter models.},

the rotation curve or the adopted surface density, and to a substantial
increase in the random motions of the central part of the disk. It is
found that the cool disk component must have a low mass-to-light ratio,
and that the dark material is the dominant contributor to the total
mass. The population models predict much lower masses for early-type
disk galaxies than those deduced from their rotation curves.},

These descriptions are employed to quantify the amplitude and location of baryonic features in linear theory. While baryonic oscillations are prominent if the baryon fraction Ωb/Ω0 {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} Ω0h2 + 0.2, the main effect in more conventional cosmologies is a sharp suppression in the transfer function below the sound horizon.

Using order-of-magnitude estimations, we show that observed nuclear stellar clusters avoid the regime where stellar collisions are dynamically relevant over the whole system, while resolved detections of massive black holes are well into such collision-dominated regimes. We interpret this result in terms of massive black holes and nuclear stellar clusters being different evolutionary paths of a common formation mechanism, unified under the standard terminology of both being central massive objects. We propose a formation scenario where central massive objects more massive than ∼108 M⊙, which also have relaxation times longer that their collision times, will be too dense (in virial equilibrium) to be globally stable against stellar collisions, and most of the mass will collapse toward the formation of a massive black hole. Contrarily, this will only be the case at the core of less dense central massive objects, leading to the formation of black holes with much lower black hole efficiencies \$\{{\textbackslash}epsilon \}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BH\}\}={\textbackslash}tfrac\{\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{BH\}\}\}\{\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}mathrm\{CMO\}\}\}\$ , with these efficiencies ɛBH drastically growing for central massive objects more massive than ∼107 M⊙, approaching unity around MCMO ∼ 108 M⊙.

Here, we broaden that study and investigate the dependence of the merger rate of haloes on their surrounding environment. A number of local mass overdensity variables, both including and excluding the halo mass itself, are tested as measures of a halo's environment. The simple functional dependence on z, M0, and ξ of the merger rate found in our earlier work, is largely preserved in different environments, but we find that the overall amplitude of the merger rate has a strong positive correlation with the environmental densities. For galaxy-mass haloes, we find mergers to occur {\textasciitilde}2.5 times more frequently in the densest regions than in voids at both z = 0 and higher redshifts. Higher mass haloes show similar trends. We present a fitting form for this environmental dependence that is a function of both mass and local density and valid out to z = 2. The amplitude of the progenitor (or conditional) mass function shows a similar correlation with local overdensity, suggesting that the extended Press-Schechter model for halo growth needs to be modified to incorporate environmental effects.},

of z out to z {\textasciitilde} 15; the dependence on halo mass is weak ({\textasciitilde}

a function of mass and redshift. This mean rate is 46Msolar
yr-1 for 1012Msolar haloes at z = 0,

Our aim is to identify new line-ratio diagnostics to discriminate between gas photoionization by active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star formation. We use a standard photoionization code to compute the emission from AGN narrow-line regions and compare this with calculations of the nebular emission from star-forming galaxies achieved using the same code. We confirm the appropriateness of widely used optical spectral diagnostics of nuclear activity versus star formation and explore new diagnostics at ultraviolet wavelengths.

Diagrams involving at least three of these lines allow an even more stringent distinction between active and inactive galaxies, as well as valuable constraints on interstellar gas parameters and the shape of the ionizing radiation. Several line ratios involving Ne-based emission lines, such as [Ne IV] λ2424, [Ne III] λ3343 and [Ne V] λ3426, are also good diagnostics of nuclear activity. Our results provide a comprehensive framework to identify the sources of photoionization and physical conditions of the ionized gas from the ultraviolet and optical nebular emission from galaxies. This will be particularly useful to interpret observations of high-redshift galaxies with future facilities, such as the James Webb Space Telescope and extremely large ground-based telescopes.},

We investigate the effect on the colours of satellite galaxies produced by the ram-pressure stripping of their hot-gaseous atmospheres as the satellites orbit within their parent halo. We incorporate a model of the stripping process based on detailed hydrodynamic simulations within the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. The simulations show that the environment in groups and clusters is less aggressive than previously assumed. The main uncertainty in the model is the treatment of gas expelled by supernovae. With reasonable assumptions for the stripping of this material, we find that satellite galaxies are able to retain a significant fraction of their hot gas for several Gyr, thereby replenishing their reservoirs of cold, star-forming gas and remaining blue for a relatively long period of time. A bimodal distribution of galaxy colours, similar to that observed in Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, is established and the colours of the satellite galaxies are in good agreement with the data. In addition, our model naturally accounts for the observed dependence of satellite colours on environment, from small groups to high-mass clusters.},

	abstract = {The delay time distribution (DTD) of Type-Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is important for understanding chemical evolution, SN Ia progenitors, and SN Ia physics. Past estimates of the DTD in galaxy clusters have been deduced from SN Ia rates measured in cluster samples observed at various redshifts, corresponding to different time intervals after a presumed initial brief burst of star formation. A recent analysis of a cluster sample at \$z=1.13-1.75\$ confirmed indications from previous studies of lower-redshift clusters, that the DTD has a power-law form, \$\{{\textbackslash}rm DTD\}(t)=R\_1 (t/\{{\textbackslash}rm Gyr\}){\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}alpha\$, with amplitude \$R\_1\$, at delay \$t=1{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}rm Gyr\$, several times higher than measured in field-galaxy environments. This implied that SNe Ia are somehow produced in larger numbers by the stellar populations in clusters. This conclusion, however, could have been affected by the implicit assumption that the stars were formed in a single brief starburst at high \$z\$. Here, we re-derive the DTD from the cluster SN Ia data, but relax the single-burst assumption. Instead, we allow for a range of star-formation histories and dust extinctions for each cluster. Via MCMC modeling, we simultaneously fit, using stellar population synthesis models and DTD models, the integrated galaxy-light photometry in several bands, and the SN Ia numbers discovered in each cluster. With these more-realistic assumptions, we find a best-fit DTD with power-law index \${\textbackslash}alpha=-1.09\_\{-0.12\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.15\}\$, and amplitude \$R\_1=0.41\_\{-0.10\}{\textasciicircum}\{+0.12\}{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-12\}{\textasciitilde}\{{\textbackslash}rm yr\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\{{\textbackslash}rm M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. We confirm a cluster-environment DTD with a larger amplitude than the field-galaxy DTD, by a factor \${\textbackslash}sim2-3\$ (at \$3.8{\textbackslash}sigma\$). Cluster and field DTDs have consistent slopes of \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash}approx-1.1\$.},

We focus on the Magellanic system including the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC, SMC), M33, and a few dwarfs as observed in the J = 1-0 12CO transition at 2.6-mm wavelength. The X factor, a conversion factor of the 12CO intensity to total molecular column density, and the GMC mass distribution, dN/dM, are similar among these galaxies, suggesting that GMCs share similar properties in the Local Group. The GMCs are classified into three types according to their level of star-formation activity and the types are interpreted in terms of evolution in 20-30 Myr rather than as three different generic types. A three-dimensional comparison including the velocity axis has revealed that GMCs in the LMC are associated with Hi envelopes. The Hi envelopes are probably gravitationally bound and may be infalling to increase the GMC mass via Hi-H2 conversion. Recent submillimeter observations are revealing dense and warm clumps in GMCs, suggesting that the interior of a GMC also follows contraction leading to star formation on a similar timescale. Finally, we present an attempt to place these GMC properties among more distant galaxies and discuss future observational prospects.},

median-likelihood estimates of these parameters using a large library of model spectra at medium-high resolution, covering a comprehensive range of star formation histories. The constraints we derive are set by the simultaneous fit of five spectral absorption features, which are well reproduced by our population synthesis models. By design, these
constraints depend only weakly on the alpha/Fe element abundance ratio. Our sample includes galaxies of all types spanning the full range in star formation activity, from dormant early-type to actively
star-forming galaxies. By analysing a subsample of 44254 high-quality spectra, we show that, in the mean, galaxies follow a sequence of increasing stellar metallicity, age and stellar mass at increasing 4000-Åbreak strength. For galaxies of intermediate mass, stronger Balmer absorption at fixed 4000-Åbreak strength is associated with higher metallicity and younger age. We investigate how stellar
metallicity and age depend on total galaxy stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies are typically young and metal-poor, massive galaxies old and metal-rich, with a rapid transition between these regimes over the stellar mass range 3 × 109{\textless}{\textasciitilde}M*{\textless}{\textasciitilde} 3
× 1010Msolar. Both high- and
low-concentration galaxies follow these relations, but there is a large dispersion in stellar metallicity at fixed stellar mass, especially for low-concentration galaxies of intermediate mass. Despite the large scatter, the relation between stellar metallicity and stellar mass is similar to the correlation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and stellar mass for star-forming galaxies. This is confirmed by the good correlation between stellar metallicity and gas-phase oxygen abundance for galaxies with both measures. The substantial range in stellar metallicity at fixed gas-phase oxygen abundance suggests that gas ejection and/or accretion are important factors in galactic chemical evolution.},

the framework of Friedmann cosmological models from redshift z=10(4) to

the expanding universe is presented and critically discussed. On this
basis, calculations are carried out of the abundance of 21 molecular
species as function of redshift, for different values of the
cosmological parameters Omega\_0 , eta and H\_0, evaluating consistently
the molecular heating and cooling due to H\_2, {HD} and {LiH} molecules. One
of the major improvements of this work is the use of a better treatment
of H recombination that leads to a reduction of a factor 2-3 in the
abundance of electrons and H(+) at freeze-out, with respect to previous
studies. The lower residual ionization has a negative effect on the
chemistry of the primordial gas in which electrons and protons act as
catalysts in the formation of the first molecules. We find that in the
standard model (h=0.67, eta\_ {10}=4.5, Omega\_0 =1 and {[D/H]} =4.3x 10(-5)

	abstract = {We use two very large cosmological simulations to study how the density profiles of relaxed Lambda cold dark matter dark haloes depend on redshift and on halo mass.

The best-fitting value of the additional shape parameter, alpha, increases gradually with mass, from alpha {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.16 for present-day galaxy haloes to alpha {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.3 for the rarest and most massive clusters. Halo concentrations depend only weakly on mass at z = 0, and this dependence weakens further at earlier times.

These results agree well with those of Zhao et al. and support the idea that halo densities reflect the density of the universe at the time they formed, as proposed by Navarro, Frenk \& White. With their original parameters, the {NFW} prescription overpredicts halo concentrations at high redshift. This shortcoming can be reduced by modifying the definition of halo formation time, although the evolution of the concentrations of Milky Way mass haloes is still not reproduced well. In contrast, the much-used revisions of the {NFW} prescription by Bullock et al. and Eke, Navarro \& Steinmetz predict a steeper drop in concentration at the highest masses and stronger evolution with redshift than are compatible with our numerical data. Modifying the parameters of these models can reduce the discrepancy at high masses, but the overly rapid redshift evolution remains. These results have important implications for currently planned surveys of distant clusters.},

	abstract = {Using a cosmological N-body simulation and a sample of resimulated 
cluster-like haloes, we study the mass-loss rates of dark matter
subhaloes, and interpret the mass function of subhaloes at redshift zero
in terms of the evolution of the mass function of systems accreted by
the main halo progenitor (hereafter called the `unevolved subhalo mass
function'). When expressed in terms of the ratio between the mass of the
subhalo at the time of accretion, mv, and the present day
host mass, M0, the unevolved subhalo mass function is found
to be universal, in that it is independent of the mass of the host halo.
However, the subhalo mass function at redshift zero (hereafter called
the `evolved subhalo mass function') clearly depends on M0,
in that more massive host haloes host more subhaloes. In order to relate
the unevolved and evolved subhalo mass functions, we measure the subhalo
mass-loss rate as a function of host mass and redshift. We find that the
average, specific mass-loss rate of dark matter subhaloes depends mainly
on redshift, with only a very weak dependence on the instantaneous ratio
between the mass of the subhalo, msb, and that of the host
halo at that time Mv. In fact, to good approximation, subhalo
masses `decay' exponentially, with a decay time that is proportional to
the instantaneous dynamical time of the host halo. Combined with the
fact that more massive haloes assemble later, these results suggest a
pleasingly simple picture for the evolution and mass dependence of the
evolved subhalo mass function. Less massive host haloes accrete their
subhaloes earlier, which are thus subjected to mass-loss for a longer
time. In addition, their subhaloes are typically accreted by denser
hosts, which causes an additional boost of the mass-loss rate. To test
the self-consistency of this picture, we use semi-analytical merger
trees constructed using the extended Press-Schechter formalism, and
evolve the subhalo populations using the average mass-loss rates
obtained from our simulations. The resulting subhalo mass functions are
found to be in good agreement with the simulations. Our model can be
applied to semi-analytical methods of galaxy formation, to accurately
follow the time evolution of subhalo masses.},

	abstract = {We study the reaction of a globular star cluster to a time-varying tidal perturbation (gravitational shock) using self-consistent N-body
simulations and address two questions. First, to what extent is the cluster interior protected by adiabatic invariants? Second, how much further energy change does the postshock evolution of the cluster potential produce and how much does it affect the dispersion of stellar energies? We introduce the ``adiabatic correction'' as ratio of the energy change, {\textless}ΔE{\textgreater}, to its value in the impulse
approximation. When the potential is kept fixed, the numerical results for the adiabatic correction for stars with orbital frequency ω
can be approximated as
(1+ω2τ2)-γ. For shocks
with the characteristic duration of the order of the half-mass dynamical time of the cluster, τ{\textless}{\textasciitilde}tdyn,h, the exponent
γ=5/2. For more prolonged shocks, τ{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}4tdyn,h,
the adiabatic correction is shallower, γ=3/2. When we allow for
self-gravity and potential oscillations that follow the shock, the energy of stars in the core changes significantly while the total energy of the system is conserved. Paradoxically, the postshock potential fluctuations reduce the total amount of energy dispersion,
{\textless}ΔE2{\textgreater}. The effect is small but real and is due to
the postshock energy change being statistically anticorrelated with the shock-induced heating. These results are to be applied to Fokker-Planck models of the evolution of globular clusters.},

We integrate the tidal force over accurate orbits in various models for the primary by using the impulse approximation, coupled with adiabatic corrections that allow for time variation of the perturbation. We verify the results with direct N-body simulations, and we also compare them with the conventional straight-path approximation. Heating on highly eccentric orbits dominates, since adiabatic corrections strictly prohibit energy changes on low-eccentricity orbits. The results are illustrated for globular cluster {NGC} 6712. For the orbital eccentricities higher than 0.9, the future lifetime of {NGC} 6712 is less than 10{\textasciicircum}10 yr.

I show that this characteristic scale can be up to an order of magnitude lower than the linear-theory Jeans mass, and that even if one defines the Jeans mass at a higher
overdensity, it does not track the evolution of this characteristic suppression mass. Instead, the filtering mass, which corresponds directly to the scale over which baryonic perturbations are smoothed in linear perturbation theory, provides a remarkably good fit to the characteristic mass scale. Thus, it appears that the effect of
reionization on structure formation in both the linear and nonlinear regimes is described by a single characteristic scale, the filtering scale of baryonic perturbations. In contrast to the Jeans mass, the filtering mass depends on the full thermal history of the gas instead of the instantaneous value of the sound speed, so it accounts for the finite time required for pressure to influence the gas distribution in the expanding universe. In addition to the characteristic suppression mass, I study the full shape of the probability distribution to find an object with a given gas mass among all the objects with the same total mass, and I show that the numerical results can be described by a simple fitting formula that again depends only on the filtering mass. This simple description of the probability distribution may be useful for semianalytical modeling of structure formation in the early universe.},

	abstract = {The cooling of gas in the centers of dark matter halos is expected to lead to a more concentrated dark matter distribution. The response of dark matter to the condensation of baryons is usually calculated using the model of adiabatic contraction, which assumes spherical symmetry and circular orbits. In contrast, halos in the hierarchical structure formation scenarios grow via multiple violent mergers and accretion along filaments, and particle orbits in the halos are highly eccentric. We study the effects of the cooling of gas in the inner regions of halos using high-resolution cosmological simulations that include gas dynamics, radiative cooling, and star formation. We find that the dissipation of gas indeed increases the density of dark matter and steepens its radial profile in the inner regions of halos compared to the case without cooling. For the first time, we test the adiabatic contraction model in cosmological simulations and find that the standard model systematically overpredicts the increase of dark matter density in the inner 5\% of the virial radius. We show that the model can be improved by a simple modification of the assumed invariant from M(r)r to M(r)r, where r and r are the current and orbit-averaged particle positions. This modification approximately accounts for orbital eccentricities of particles and reproduces simulation profiles to within 10\%-20\%. We present analytical fitting functions that accurately describe the transformation of the dark matter profile in the modified model and can be used for interpretation of observations.},

        abstract = {The condensation of gas and stars in the inner regions of dark matter halos leads to a more concentrated dark matter distribution. While this effect is based on simple gravitational physics, the question of its validity in hierarchical galaxy formation has led to an active debate in the literature. We use a collection of several state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic simulations to study the halo contraction effect in systems ranging from dwarf galaxies to clusters of galaxies, at high and low redshift. The simulations are run by different groups with different codes and include hierarchical merging, gas cooling, star formation, and stellar feedback. We show that in all our cases the inner dark matter density increases relative to the matching simulation without baryon dissipation, at least by a factor of several. The strength of the contraction effect varies from system to system and cannot be reduced to a simple prescription. We present a revised analytical model that describes the contracted mass profile to an rms accuracy of about 10\%. The model can be used to effectively bracket the response of the dark matter halo to baryon dissipation. The halo contraction effect is real and must be included in modeling of the mass distribution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.},

The {RV}-dependent {CCM} relationship of Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis and the sample of extinction curves used to derive this relationship are used to describe the general behavior of Milky Way extinction curves. The ultraviolet portion of the {SMC} and {LMC} extinction curves are derived from archival {IUE} data, except for one new {SMC} extinction curve, which was measured using Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph observations. The optical extinction curves are derived from new (for the {SMC}) and literature {UBVRI} photometry (for the {LMC}). The near-infrared extinction curves are calculated mainly from 2MASS photometry supplemented with {DENIS} and new {JHK} photometry. For each extinction curve, we give {RV} = A(V)/E(B - V) and N(H I) values that probe the same dust column as the extinction curve. We compare the properties of the {SMC} and {LMC} extinction curves with the {CCM} relationship three different ways: each curve by itself, the behavior of extinction at different wavelengths with {RV}, and the behavior of the extinction curve Fitzpatrick and Massa fit parameters with {RV}. As has been found previously, we find that a small number of {LMC} extinction curves are consistent with the {CCM} relationship, but the majority of the {LMC} and all the {SMC} curves do not follow the {CCM} relationship. For the first time, we find that the {CCM} relationship seems to form a bound on the properties of all the {LMC} and {SMC} extinction curves. This result strengthens the picture dust extinction curves exhibit of a continuum of properties between those found in the Milky Way and the {SMC} bar. Tentative evidence based on the behavior of the extinction curves with dust-to-gas ratio suggests that the continuum of dust extinction curves is possibly caused by the environmental stresses of nearby star formation activity.},

We use magnetohydrodynamic simulations of GMCs (including feedback) to forward-model the relationship between the true GMC SFE and observational proxies. We show that individual GMCs trace broad ranges of observed SFE throughout collapse, star formation, and disruption. Low measured SFEs (\{≪\} 1 per cent) are `real' but correspond to early stages; the true `per-freefall' SFE where most stars actually form can be much larger. Very high (\{≫\} 10 per cent) values are often artificially enhanced by rapid gas dispersal. Simulations including stellar feedback reproduce observed GMC-scale SFEs, but simulations without feedback produce 20× larger SFEs. Radiative feedback dominates among mechanisms simulated. An anticorrelation of SFE with cloud mass is shown to be an observational artefact. We also explore individual dense `clumps' within GMCs and show that (with feedback) their bulk properties agree well with observations. Predicted SFEs within the dense clumps are ∼2× larger than observed, possibly indicating physics other than feedback from massive (main-sequence) stars is needed to regulate their collapse.},

modelling capabilities and applied them simultaneously to the stored
halo/subhalo merger trees of the Millennium and Millennium-{II}
Simulations ({MS} and {MS-II}, respectively). These differ by a factor of
125 in mass resolution, allowing explicit testing of resolution effects
on predicted galaxy properties. We have revised the treatment of the
transition between the rapid infall and cooling flow regimes of gas
accretion, of the sizes of bulges, and of gaseous and stellar discs, of
supernova feedback, of the transition between central and satellite
status as galaxies fall into larger systems, and of gas and star
stripping, once they become satellites. Plausible values of efficiency
and scaling parameters yield an excellent fit not only to the observed
abundance of low-redshift galaxies over five orders of magnitude in
stellar mass and 9 mag in luminosity, but also to the observed abundance
of Milky Way satellites. This suggests that reionization effects may not
be needed to solve the 'missing-satellite' problem, except, perhaps, for
the faintest objects. The same model matches the observed large-scale
clustering of galaxies as a function of stellar mass and colour. The fit
remains excellent down to ˜30 kpc for massive galaxies. For
M* {\textless} 6 × 1010 M⊙, however,
the model overpredicts clustering at scales below ˜1 Mpc,
suggesting that the assumed fluctuation amplitude, σ8=
0.9, is too high. The observed difference in clustering between active
and passive galaxies is matched quite well for all masses. Galaxy
distributions within rich clusters agree between the simulations and
match those observed, but only if galaxies without dark matter subhaloes
(so-called orphans) are included. Even at {MS-II} resolution, schemes
which assign galaxies only to resolved dark matter subhaloes cannot
match observed clusters. Our model predicts a larger passive fraction
among low-mass galaxies than is observed, as well as an overabundance of
˜1010 M⊙ galaxies beyond z˜ 0.6.
(The abundance of ˜1011 M⊙ galaxies is
matched out to z˜ 3.) These discrepancies appear to reflect
deficiencies in the way star formation rates are modelled.},

	abstract = {High resolution cosmological N-body simulations of four galaxy-scale dark matter halos are compared to corresponding N-body/hydrodynamical simulations containing dark matter, stars and gas. The simulations without baryons share features with others described in the literature in that the dark matter density slope continuously decreases towards the center, with a density {rhoDM∝r-1.3�0.2,} at about 1\% of the virial radius for our Milky Way sized galaxies. The central cusps in the simulations which also contain baryons steepen significantly, to {rhoDM∝r-1.9�0.2,} with an indication of the inner logarithmic slope converging. Models of adiabatic contraction of dark matter halos due to the central buildup of stellar/gaseous galaxies are examined. The simplest and most commonly used model, by Blumenthal et al., is shown to overestimate the central dark matter density considerably. A modified model proposed by Gnedin et al. is tested and it is shown that, while it is a considerable improvement, it is not perfect. Moreover, it is found that the contraction parameters in their model not only depend on the orbital structure of the dark-matter only halos but also on the stellar feedback prescription which is most relevant for the baryonic distribution. Implications for dark matter annihilation at the galactic center are discussed and it is found that, although our simulations show a considerable reduced dark matter halo contraction as compared to the Blumenthal et al. model, the fluxes from dark matter annihilation are still expected to be enhanced by at least a factor of a hundred, as compared to dark-matter only halos. Finally, it is shown that, while dark-matter only halos are typically prolate, the dark matter halos containing baryons are mildly oblate with minor-to-major axis ratios of c/a=0.73�0.11, with their flattening aligned with the central baryonic disks.},

	abstract = {We have reexamined the relation between the mass of the central black
holes in nearby galaxies, Mbh, and the stellar mass of the
surrounding spheroid or bulge, Mbulge. For a total of 30
galaxies bulge masses were derived through Jeans equation modeling or
adopted from dynamical models in the literature. In stellar
mass-to-light ratios, the spheroids and bulges span a range of a factor
of 8. The bulge masses were related to well-determined black hole masses
taken from the literature. With these improved values for
Mbh, compared to Magorrian et al., and our redetermination of
Mbulge, we find that the {Mbh-Mbulge}
relation becomes very tight. We find
{Mbh{\textasciitilde}M1.12+/-0.06bulge} with an observed
scatter of {\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.30 dex, a fraction of which can be attributed to
measurement errors. The scatter in this relation is therefore comparable
to the scatter in the relations of Mbh with sigma and the
stellar concentration. These results confirm and refine the work of
Marconi \& Hunt. For Mbulge{\textasciitilde}5�1010
Msolar the median black hole mass is 0.14\%+/-0.04\% of the
bulge mass.},

	abstract = {This is the first paper of a series that describes the methods and basic results of the {GALICS} model {(Galaxies} In Cosmological Simulations). {GALICS} is a hybrid model for hierarchical galaxy formation studies, combining the outputs of large cosmological N-body simulations with simple, semi-analytic recipes to describe the fate of the baryons within dark matter haloes. The simulations produce a detailed merging tree for the dark matter haloes, including complete knowledge of the statistical properties arising from the gravitational forces. We intend to predict the overall statistical properties of galaxies, with special emphasis on the panchromatic spectral energy distribution emitted by galaxies in the ultraviolet/optical and infrared/submillimetre wavelength ranges. In this paper, we outline the physically motivated assumptions and key free parameters that go into the model, comparing and contrasting with other parallel efforts. We specifically illustrate the success of the model in comparison with several data sets, showing how it is able to predict the galaxy disc sizes, colours, luminosity functions from the ultraviolet to far infrared, the {Tully-Fisher} and {Faber-Jackson} relations, and the fundamental plane in the local Universe. We also identify certain areas where the model fails, or where the assumptions needed to succeed are at odds with observations, and pay special attention to understanding the effects of the finite resolution of the simulations on the predictions made. Other papers in this series will take advantage of different data sets available in the literature to extend the study of the limitations and predictive power of {GALICS,} with particular emphasis put on high-redshift galaxies.},

	shorttitle = {What Does a Submillimeter Galaxy Selection Actually Select?},
	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011arXiv1101.0002H},
	abstract = {We perform {3-D} dust radiative transfer {(RT)} calculations on hydrodynamic simulations of isolated and merging disk galaxies in order to quantitatively study the dependence of observed-frame submillimeter (submm) flux density on galaxy properties. We find that submm flux density and star formation rate {(SFR)} are related in dramatically different ways for quiescently star-forming galaxies and starbursts. Because the stars formed in the merger-induced starburst do not dominate the bolometric luminosity and the rapid drop in dust mass and more compact geometry cause a sharp increase in dust temperature during the burst, starbursts are very inefficient at boosting submm flux density (e.g., a \${\textbackslash}ga16\$x boost in {SFR} yields a \${\textbackslash}la 2\$x boost in submm flux density). Moreover, the ratio of submm flux density to {SFR} differs significantly between the two modes; thus one cannot assume that the galaxies with highest submm flux density are necessarily those with the highest bolometric luminosity or {SFR.} These results have important consequences for the submillimeter-selected galaxy {(SMG)} population. Among them are: 1. The {SMG} population is heterogeneous. In addition to the canonical scenario of merger-driven starbursts, there is a galaxy pair contribution in which two disks undergoing a major merger but not yet strongly interacting are blended into one submm source because of the large (\${\textbackslash}ga 15\$", or \${\textbackslash}sim 130\$ kpc at \$z = 2\$) beam of submm bolometers. 2. {SMGs} must be very massive {(\$M\_{{\textbackslash}star}} {\textbackslash}ga 6 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}{10} {\textbackslash}msun\$). 3. The infall phase makes the {SMG} duty cycle a factor of a few greater than what is expected for a merger-driven starburst. {(Abridged.)}},

	abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that the first generation of stars may have
been quite massive ({\textasciitilde}100-300 Msolar). Could these stars have
left a distinct nucleosynthetic signature? We explore the
nucleosynthesis of helium cores in the mass range {MHe=64-133}
Msolar, corresponding to main-sequence star masses of
approximately 140-260 Msolar. Above {MHe=133}
Msolar, without rotation and using current reaction rates, a
black hole is formed, and no nucleosynthesis is ejected. For lighter
helium core masses, {\textasciitilde}40-63 Msolar, violent pulsations occur,
induced by the pair instability and accompanied by supernova-like mass
ejection, but the star eventually produces a large iron core in
hydrostatic equilibrium. It is likely that this core, too, collapses to
a black hole, thus cleanly separating the heavy-element nucleosynthesis
of pair instability supernovae from those of other masses, both above
and below. Indeed, black hole formation is a likely outcome for all
Population {III} stars with main-sequence masses between about 25 and 140
Msolar {(MHe=9-63} Msolar) as well as
those above 260 Msolar. Nucleosynthesis in pair instability
supernovae varies greatly with the mass of the helium core. This core
determines the maximum temperature reached during the bounce. At the
upper range of exploding core masses, a maximum of 57 Msolar
of {56Ni} is produced, making these the most energetic and the
brightest thermonuclear explosions in the universe. Integrating over a
distribution of masses, we find that pair instability supernovae produce
a roughly solar distribution of nuclei having even nuclear charge {(Si,}
S, Ar, etc.) but are remarkably deficient in producing elements with odd
nuclear {charge-Na,} Al, P, V, Mn, etc. This is because there is no stage
of stable post-helium burning to set the neutron excess. Also,
essentially no elements heavier than zinc are produced owing to a lack
of s- and r-processes. The {Fe/Si} ratio is quite sensitive to whether the
upper bound on the initial mass function is over 260 Msolar
or somewhere between 140 and 260 Msolar. When the yields of
pair instability supernovae are combined with reasonable estimates of
the nucleosynthesis of Population {III} stars from 12 to 40
Msolar, this distinctive pattern of deficient production of
{odd-Z} elements persists. Some possible strategies for testing our
predictions are discussed.},

	abstract = {We compare the results of two techniques used to calculate the evolution of cooling gas during galaxy formation: smooth particle hydrodynamics {(SPH)} simulations and semi-analytic modelling. We improve upon the earlier statistical comparison of Benson et al. by taking halo merger histories from the dark matter component of the {SPH} simulation, which allows us to compare the evolution of galaxies on an object-by-object basis in the two treatments. We use a `stripped-down' version of the semi-analytic model described by Helly et al. that includes only shock heating and radiative cooling of gas and which is adjusted to mimic the resolution and other parameters of a comparison {SPH} simulation as closely as possible. We compare the total mass of gas that cools in haloes of different mass as a function of redshift and the masses and spatial distribution of individual `galaxies'. At a redshift of z= 0, the cooled gas mass in well-resolved haloes agrees remarkably well (to better than {\textbackslash}textasciitilde20 per cent) in the {SPH} simulation and stripped-down semi-analytic model. At high redshift, resolution effects in the simulation become increasingly important and, as a result, more gas tends to cool in low-mass haloes in the {SPH} simulation than in the semi-analytic model. The cold gas mass function of individual galaxies in the two treatments at z= 0 also agrees very well and, when the effects of mergers are accounted for, the masses of individual galaxies and their two-point correlation functions are also in excellent agreement in the two treatments. Thus, our comparison confirms and extends the earlier conclusion of Benson et al. that {SPH} simulations and semi-analytic models give consistent results for the evolution of cooling galactic gas.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new physical recipe into the De Lucia \& Blaizot
version of the Munich semi-analytic model built upon the Millennium dark
matter simulation: the tidal stripping of stellar material from
satellite galaxies during mergers.

To test the significance of the new physical process, we apply a Monte
Carlo Markov Chain parameter estimation technique constraining the model
with the K-band luminosity function, B - V colours and the black
hole-bulge mass relation. The differences in parameter correlations, and
in the allowed regions in likelihood space, reveal the impact of the new
physics on the basic ingredients of the model, such as the star
formation laws, feedback recipes and the black hole growth model.

With satellite disruption in place, we get a model likelihood four times
higher than in the original model, indicating that the new process seems
to be favoured by observations. This is achieved mainly due to a
reduction in black hole growth that produces a better agreement between
the properties of central black holes and host galaxies. Compared to the
best-fitting model without disruption, the new model removes the excess
of dwarf galaxies in the original recipe with a more modest supernova
heating.

The new model is now consistent with the three observational data sets
used to constrain it, while significantly improving the agreement with
observations for the distribution of metals in stars. Moreover, the
model now has predictions for the intra-cluster light, a very
significant component of large groups and clusters, that agree with
observational estimates.},

	abstract = {We present a statistical exploration of the parameter space of the De Lucia and Blaizot version of the Munich semi-analytic {(SA)} model built upon the Millennium dark matter simulation. This is achieved by applying a Monte Carlo Markov Chain method to constrain the six free parameters that define the stellar and black hole mass functions at redshift zero. The model is tested against three different observational data sets, including the galaxy K-band luminosity function, B - V colours and the black hole-bulge mass relation, separately and combined, to obtain mean values, confidence limits and likelihood contours for the best-fitting model. Using each observational data set independently, we discuss how the {SA} model parameters affect each galaxy property and find that there are strong correlations between them. We analyse to what extent these are simply reflections of the observational constraints, or whether they can lead to improved understandings of the physics of galaxy formation. When all the observations are combined, we find reasonable agreement between the majority of the previously published parameter values and our confidence limits. However, the need to suppress dwarf galaxy formation requires the strength of the supernova feedback to be significantly higher in our best-fitting solution than in previous work. To balance this, we require the feedback to become ineffective in haloes of lower mass than before, so as to permit the formation of sufficient high-luminosity galaxies: unfortunately, this leads to an excess of galaxies around L*. Although the best fit is formally consistent with the data, there is no region of parameter space that reproduces the shape of galaxy luminosity function across the whole magnitude range. For our best fit, we present the model predictions for the {bJ-band} luminosity and stellar mass functions. We find a systematic disagreement between the observed mass function and the predictions from the K-band constraint, which we explain in light of recent works that suggest uncertainties of up to 0.3 dex in the mass determination from stellar population synthesis models. We discuss modifications to the {SA} model that might simultaneously improve the fit to the observed mass function and reduce the reliance on excessive supernova feedback in small haloes.},

other intrinsic properties of the galaxies (e.g. positions, peculiar
velocities, stellar masses, sizes, morphologies, gas fractions, star
formation rates, metallicities, halo properties). Guo et al. tuned their
model to fit the low-redshift galaxy population but noted that at z≥
1 it overpredicts the abundance of galaxies below the 'knee' of the
stellar mass function. Here we extend the comparison to deep galaxy
counts in the B, i, J, K and {IRAC} 3.6, 4.5 and 5.8 μ m bands, to the
redshift distributions of K and 5.8 μ m selected galaxies, the
evolution of rest-frame luminosity functions in the B and K bands and
the evolution of rest-frame optical versus near-infrared colours. The B,
i and J counts are well reproduced, but at longer wavelengths the
overabundant high-redshift galaxies produce excess faint counts. At
bright magnitudes, counts in the {IRAC} bands are underpredicted,
reflecting overly low stellar metallicities and the neglect of
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission. The predicted redshift
distributions for K and 5.8 μ m selected samples highlight the effect
of emission from thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ({AGB)} stars.
The full treatment of the Maraston model predicts three times as many
z˜ 2 galaxies in faint 5.8 μ m selected samples as the model of
Bruzual \& Charlot, whereas the two models give similar predictions
for K-band selected samples. Although luminosity functions are
adequately reproduced out to z˜ 3 in rest-frame B, the same is
true at rest-frame K only if thermally pulsating {AGB} emission is
included, and then only at high luminosity. Fainter than
L★, the two synthesis models agree but overpredict the
number of galaxies, another reflection of the overabundance of
˜1010 M⊙ model galaxies at z≥ 1. The
model predicts that red, passive galaxies should already be in place at

constraints alone are imposed, we reproduce the results of previous

reproduce observed galaxy abundances at all redshifts simultaneously,
reflecting the fact that low-mass galaxies form too early and thus are
overabundant at high redshift in this model. The data require the
efficiency with which galactic wind ejecta are reaccreted to vary with
redshift and halo mass quite differently than previously assumed. We
propose a specific model in which reincorporation time-scales vary
inversely with halo mass and are independent of redshift. This produces
an evolving galaxy population which fits observed abundances as a
function of stellar mass, B- and K-band luminosity at all redshifts
simultaneously. It also produces a significant improvement in two other
areas where previous models were deficient. It leads to present day
dwarf galaxy populations which are younger, bluer, more strongly star

formation models. We find that the inclusion of these components greatly
enhances the probability for strong lensing compared to a `dark matter
only' universe. The identification of the `lenses' associated with
strong-lensing events reveals that the stellar mass of galaxies (i)
significantly enhances the strong-lensing cross-sections of group and
cluster haloes and (ii) gives rise to strong lensing in smaller haloes,
which would not produce noticeable effects in the absence of the stars.
Even if we consider only image splittings {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}10arcsec, the luminous
matter can enhance the strong-lensing optical depths by up to a factor
of 2.},

	abstract = {Galaxies with stellar bulges are generically observed to host supermassive black holes {(SMBHs).} The hierarchical merging of galaxies should therefore lead to the formation of {SMBH} binaries. Merging of old massive galaxies with little gas promotes the formation of low-density nuclei where {SMBH} binaries are expected to survive over long times. If the binary lifetime exceeds the typical time between mergers, then triple black hole {(BH)} systems may form. We study the statistics of close triple {SMBH} encounters in galactic nuclei by computing a series of three-body orbits with physically motivated initial conditions appropriate for giant elliptical galaxies. Our simulations include a smooth background potential consisting of a stellar bulge plus a dark matter halo, drag forces due to gravitational radiation and dynamical friction on the stars and dark matter, and a simple model of the time evolution of the inner density profile under heating and mass ejection by the {SMBHs.} We find that the binary pair coalesces as a result of repeated close encounters in {\textasciitilde}85 per cent of our runs, and in {\textasciitilde}15 per cent of cases a new eccentric binary forms from the third {SMBH} and binary remnant and coalesces during the run time. In about 40 per cent of the runs the lightest {BH} is left wandering through the galactic halo or escapes the galaxy altogether, but escape of all three {SMBHs} is exceedingly rare. The triple systems typically scour out cores with mass deficits {\textasciitilde}one-two times their total mass, which can help to account for the large cores observed in some massive elliptical galaxies, such as M87. The high coalescence rate, prevalence of very high-eccentricity orbits, and gravitational radiation `spikes' during close encounters in our runs, may provide interesting signals for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna {(LISA).}},

interstellar gas of ambient density from 10 to the 7th per cu cm, while
focusing on the problems of formation and destruction of molecules and

that such fast shocks initially dissociate almost all preexisting
molecules. Discussion covers the physical processes which determine the
post shock structure between 10 to the 4 and 10 to the 2 K. It is shown
that the chemistry of important molecular coolants H2, {CO,} {OH,} and {H2O,}
as well as {HD} and {CH,} is reduced to a relatively small set of gas phase
and grain surface reactions. Also, the chemistry follows the slow
conversion of atomic hydrogen into H2, which primarily occurs on grain
surfaces. The dependence of this H2 formation rate on grain and gas
temperatures is examined and the survival of grains behind fast shocks
is discussed. Post shock heating and cooling rates are calculated and an
appropriate, analytic, universal cooling function is developed for
molecules other than hydrogen which includes opacities from both the

	abstract = {The evolution in the comoving space density of the global average galaxy
star formation rate {(SFR)} out to a redshift around unity is well
established. Beyond z{\textasciitilde}1 there is growing evidence that this evolution is
flat or even increasing, contrary to early indications of a turnover.
Some recent analyses of z{\textasciitilde}6 photometric dropouts are suggestive of a
decline from z=3 to z{\textasciitilde}6, but there is still very little constraint on
the extent of dust obscuration at such high redshifts. In less than a
decade, numerous measurements of galaxy {SFR} density spanning z=0 to as
high as z{\textasciitilde}6 have rapidly broadened our understanding of galaxy
evolution, and a summary of existing {SFR} density measurements is
presented here. This global star formation history compilation is found
to be consistent to within factors of about 3 over essentially the
entire range 0{\textless}{\textasciitilde}6, and it can be used to constrain the evolution
of the luminosity function {(LF)} for star-forming galaxies. The {LF}
evolution for star-forming galaxies has been previously explored using
optical source counts, as well as radio source counts at 1.4 {GHz,} and a
well-known degeneracy between luminosity evolution {[L{\textasciitilde}(1+z)Q]}
and density evolution {[phi{\textasciitilde}(1+z)P]} is found. Combining the
constraints from the global {SFR} density evolution with those from the
1.4 {GHz} radio source counts at submillijansky levels allows this
degeneracy to be broken and a best-fitting evolutionary form to be
established. The preferred evolution in a
{H0=70,OmegaM=0.3,OmegaLambda=0.7}
cosmology from these combined constraints is Q=2.70+/-0.60,
P=0.15+/-0.60.},

from the rest-frame optical, soft and hard X-ray, and near- and mid-{IR} 
bands to determine the bolometric {QLF} in the redshift interval z=0-6. 
Accounting for the observed distributions of quasar column densities and 
variation of {SED} shapes, as well as their dependence on luminosity, 
makes it possible to integrate the observations in a reliable manner and 
provides a baseline in redshift and luminosity larger than that of any 
individual survey. We infer the {QLF} break luminosity and faint-end slope 
out to z{\textasciitilde}4.5 and confirm at high significance ({\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}10 σ) previous 
claims of a flattening in both the faint- and bright-end slopes with 
redshift. With the best-fit estimates of the column density distribution 
and quasar {SED}, which both depend on luminosity, a single bolometric {QLF} 
self-consistently reproduces the observed {QLFs} in all bands and at all 
redshifts for which we compile measurements. Ignoring this luminosity 
dependence does not yield a self-consistent bolometric {QLF} and there is 
no evidence for any additional dependence on redshift. We calculate the 
expected relic black hole mass function and mass density, cosmic X-ray 
background, and ionization rate as a function of redshift and find that 
they are consistent with existing measurements. The peak in the total 
quasar luminosity density is well constrained at z=2.15+/-0.05. We 
provide a number of fitting functions to the bolometric {QLF} and its 
manifestations in various bands, as well as a script to return the {QLF} 
at arbitrary frequency and redshift from these fits.},

	abstract = {We study galaxy mergers using a high-resolution cosmological {hydro/N-body} simulation with star formation and compare the measured merger timescales with theoretical predictions based on the Chandrasekhar formula. In contrast to Navarro et al., our numerical results indicate that the commonly used equation for the merger timescale given by Lacey and Cole systematically underestimates the merger timescales for minor mergers and overestimates those for major mergers. This behavior is partly explained by the poor performance of their expression for the Coulomb logarithm, ln(mpri/msat). The two alternative forms ln(1+mpri/msat) and 1/2ln[1+(mpri/msat)2] for the Coulomb logarithm can account for the mass dependence of merger timescale successfully, but both of them underestimate the merger timescale by a factor 2. Since ln(1+mpri/msat) represents the mass dependence slightly better, we adopt this expression for the Coulomb logarithm. Furthermore, we find that the dependence of the merger timescale on the circularity parameter ɛ is much weaker than the widely adopted power law ɛ0.78, whereas 0.94ɛ0.60+0.60 provides a good match to the data. Based on these findings, we present an accurate and convenient fitting formula for the merger timescale of galaxies in cold dark matter models.},

evolution. Merger trees constructed using Monte Carlo algorithms based on the extended Press-Schechter (EPS) formalism are complementary to using N-body simulations and have the advantage that they are not trammelled by limited numerical resolution and uncertainties in
identifying and linking (sub)haloes. This paper compares multiple EPS-based merger tree algorithms to simulation results using four diagnostics: progenitor mass function, mass assembly history (MAH), merger rate per descendant halo and the unevolved subhalo mass function. Spherical collapse-based methods typically overpredict major-merger rates, whereas ellipsoidal collapse dramatically overpredicts the minor-merger rate for massive haloes. The only algorithm in our
comparison that yields results in good agreement with simulations is that by Parkinson et al. (P08). We emphasize, though, that the
simulation results used as benchmarks in testing the merger trees are hampered by significant uncertainties themselves: MAHs and merger rates from different studies easily disagree by 50 per cent, even when based on the same simulation. Given this status quo, the P08 merger trees can be considered as accurate as those extracted from simulations.},

        abstract = {We combine the isothermal Jeans model and the model of adiabatic halo contraction into a semi-analytic procedure for computing the density profile of self-interacting dark-matter (SIDM) haloes with the gravitational influence from the inhabitant galaxies. The model agrees well with cosmological SIDM simulations over the entire core-forming stage up to the onset of gravothermal core-collapse. Using this model, we show that the halo response to baryons is more diverse in SIDM than in CDM and depends sensitively on galaxy size, a desirable feature in the context of the structural diversity of bright dwarfs. The fast speed of the method facilitates analyses that would be challenging for numerical simulations - notably, we quantify the SIDM halo response as functions of the baryonic properties, on a fine mesh grid spanned by the baryon-to-total-mass ratio, Mb/Mvir, and galaxy compactness, r1/2/Rvir; we show with high statistical precision that for typical Milky-Way-like systems, the SIDM profiles are similar to their CDM counterparts; and we delineate the regime of core-collapse in the Mb/Mvir - r1/2/Rvir space, for a given cross section and concentration. Finally, we compare the isothermal Jeans model with the more sophisticated gravothermal fluid model, and show that the former yields faster core formation and agrees better with cosmological simulations. We attribute the difference to whether the target CDM halo is used as a boundary condition or as the initial condition for the gravothermal evolution, and thus comment on possible improvements of the fluid model. We have made our model publicly available at https://github.com/JiangFangzhou/SIDM.},

	abstract = {For idealized (spherical, smooth) dark matter halos described by single-parameter density profiles (such as the Navarro-Frenk-White profile), there exists a one-to-one mapping between the energy of the halo and the scale radius of its density profile. The energy therefore uniquely determines the concentration parameter of such halos. We exploit this fact to predict the concentrations of dark matter halos via a random walk in halo energy space. Given a full merger tree for a halo, the total internal energy of each halo in that tree is determined by summing the internal and orbital energies of progenitor halos. We show that, when calibrated, this model can accurately reproduce the mean of the concentration-mass relation measured in N-body simulations and reproduces more of the scatter in that relation than previous models. We further test this model by examining both the autocorrelation of scale radii across time and the correlations between halo concentration and spin, and comparing them to results measured from cosmological N-body simulations. In both cases, we find that our model closely matches the N-body results. Our model is implemented within the open-source
GALACTICUS toolkit.},

	abstract = {An updated grid of stellar yields for low to intermediate-mass thermally-pulsing Asymptotic Giant Branch {(AGB)} stars are presented. The models cover a range in metallicity Z = 0.02, 0.008, 0.004, and 0.0001, and masses between {1Msun} to {6Msun.} New intermediate-mass Z = 0.0001 {AGB} models are also presented, along with a finer mass grid than used in previous studies. The yields are computed using an updated reaction rate network that includes the latest {NeNa} and {MgAl} proton capture rates, with the main result that between {\textasciitilde}6 to 30 times less Na is produced by intermediate-mass models with hot bottom burning. In low-mass {AGB} models we investigate the effect on the production of light elements of including some partial mixing of protons into the intershell region during the deepest extent of each third dredge-up episode. The protons are captured by the abundant {12C} to form a {13C} pocket. The {13C} pocket increases the yields of {19F,} {23Na,} the neutron-rich Mg and Si isotopes, {60Fe,} and {31P.} The increase in {31P} is by factors of {\textasciitilde}4 to 20, depending on the metallicity. Any structural changes caused by the addition of the {13C} pocket into the He-intershell are ignored. However, the models considered are of low mass and any such feedback is likely to be small. Further study is required to test the accuracy of the yields from the partial-mixing models. For each mass and metallicity, the yields are presented in a tabular form suitable for use in galactic chemical evolution studies or for comparison to the composition of planetary nebulae.},

	abstract = {We construct semi-analytic models for galaxy formation within the framework of a hierarchical clustering scenario for structure formation in the Universe. We use the algorithm of Kauffmann \& White to generate ensembles of merging histories for present-day dark matter haloes with a wide range of circular velocities. A galaxy is assumed to form from gas which cools and turns into stars at the centre of a halo until that halo merges with a more massive object. At this time the galaxy loses its source of new gas and becomes a non-dominant object within a larger group or cluster. Our methods thus enable us to `look inside' present dark matter haloes and investigate the formation, evolution and merging of the galaxies that they contain. We begin by investigating the properties of haloes with V\_c\_ = 220 km sˆ-1ˆ, and use the observed properties of our Milky Way system to tune the free parameters that regulate star formation, hydrodynamic feedback from supernovae and the transformation of discs into spheroids by mergers. We then show that the same parameters lead to good agreement between the properties of galaxies in a V\_c\_ = 1000 km sˆ-1ˆ halo and observational data on the Virgo cluster of galaxies. This model correctly reproduces the observed trends in the luminosity, colour, gas content and morphology of galaxies. Turning to an investigation of the properties of the galaxy population as a whole, we highlight a problem that arises when applying this model to a `standard' cold dark matter universe. If the zero-point of the {Tully-Fisher} relation is set by the properties of our Milky Way system, we find that standard {CDM} predicts too many haloes and results in a B-band luminosity density of the Universe that is a factor of 2 too high. The only apparent solution to this problem is to assume that many haloes remain observationally undetectable. We also compute the gas mass-luminosity relation for galaxies, the variation in galaxy morphology as a function of luminosity, star formation histories according to environment, the field galaxy luminosity function, and predictions for faint galaxy counts in the B and K bands. We conclude that, although it would be premature to attempt a detailed quantitative fit to specific cosmological models, the qualitative agreement between the data and the general picture that we present is already very encouraging.},

morphological-type luminosity functions are well described by a
single-Schechter function. These data are also used to derive the star
formation rate densities for each Hubble class, and the attenuated and
unattenuated (corrected for dust) cosmic spectral energy distributions,

initial mass function {(IMF)} which is enriched in massive stars by a
factor of 2-3 relative to the Scalo solar neighborhood {IMF.} We have used
published surface photometry of spiral galaxies to analyze the star
formation histories of disks independent of their bulge properties. The
ratio of the current star formation rate {(SFR)} to the average past rate
increases from of order 0.01 in Sa galaxies to 1 in {Sc-Irr} disks. This
confirms that the pronounced change in the photometric properties of
spiral galaxies along the Hubble sequence is predominantly due to
changes in the star formation histories of disks, and only secondarily
to changes in the bulge/disk ratio. A comparison of current {SFRs} and gas
masses of the sample yields median timescales for gas consumption of
approximately 3 Gyr, in the absence of stellar recycling. However, a
proper time-dependent treatment of the gas return from stars shows that
recycling extends the gas lifetimes of disks by factors of 1.5-4 for

Correcting for this, we find that the implied {SFR} to beyond z = 8 is consistent with {LBG-based} measurements after accounting for unseen galaxies at the faint end of the {UV} luminosity function. We show that this provides support for the integrated star formation in the range 6 {\textless} z {\textless} 8 to have been alone sufficient to reionize the Universe.},

	abstract = {We apply standard disk formation theory with adiabatic contraction within cuspy halo models predicted by the standard cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology. The resulting models are confronted with the
broad range of observational data available for the Milky Way and M31 galaxies. We find that there is a narrow range of parameters that can satisfy the observational constraints, but within this range, the models score remarkably well. Our favored models have virial masses of
1012 and 1.6×1012 Msolar for the Galaxy and for M31, respectively, average spin parameters
λ{\textasciitilde}0.03-0.05, and concentrations Cvir=10-17, typical
for halos of this mass in the standard ΛCDM cosmology. The models require neither dark matter modifications nor flat cores to fit the observational data. We explore two types of models, with and without the exchange of angular momentum between the dark matter and the baryons. The models without exchange give reasonable rotation curves, fulfill constraints in the solar neighborhood, and satisfy constraints at larger radii, but they may be problematic for fast rotating central bars. We explore models in which the baryons experience additional contraction due to loss of angular momentum to the surrounding dark matter. These models produce similar global properties, but the dark matter is only a 25\% of the total mass in the central 3 kpc region, allowing a fast rotating bar to persist. According to preliminary calculations, our model galaxies probably have sufficient baryonic mass in the central {\textasciitilde}3.5 kpc to reproduce recent observational values of the optical depth to microlensing events toward the Galactic center. Our dynamical models unequivocally require that about 50\% of all the gas inside the virial radius must not be in the disk or in the bulge, a result that is obtained naturally in standard semianalytic models. Assuming that the Milky Way is ``typical,'' we investigate whether the range of virial masses allowed by our dynamical models is compatible with constraints from the galaxy luminosity function. We find that if the Milky Way has a luminosity MK=-24.0, then these constraints are satisfied, but if it is more luminous (as expected if it lies on the Tully-Fisher relation), then the predicted space density is larger than the observed space density of galaxies of the corresponding luminosity by a factor of 1.5-2. We conclude that observed rotation curves and dynamical
properties of ``normal'' spiral galaxies appear to be consistent with standard ΛCDM.},

	abstract = {Supermassive black holes (BHs) have been found in 85 galaxies by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics. The Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized BH research by advancing the subject from its proof-of-concept phase into quantitative studies of BH demographics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass [Formula: see text] and the velocity dispersion sigma of the bulge component of the host galaxy. Together with similar correlations with bulge luminosity and mass, this led to the widespread belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. Conclusions based on one set of correlations from [Formula: see text] in brightest cluster ellipticals to [Formula: see text] in the smallest galaxies dominated BH work for more than a decade. New results are now
replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. A reasonable aim is to use this progress to refine our understanding of BH-galaxy coevolution. BHs with masses of
105-106M\&sun; are found in many bulgeless galaxies. Therefore, classical (elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary for BH formation. On the other hand, although they live in galaxy disks, BHs do not correlate with galaxy disks. Also, any [Formula: see text] correlations with the properties of disk-grown pseudobulges and dark matter halos are weak enough to imply no close coevolution. The above and other correlations of host-galaxy
parameters with each other and with [Formula: see text] suggest that there are four regimes of BH feedback. (1) Local, secular, episodic, and stochastic feeding of small BHs in largely bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result in coevolution. (2) Global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers rapidly grows giant BHs in short-duration,
quasar-like events whose energy feedback does affect galaxy evolution. The resulting hosts are classical bulges and coreless-rotating-disky ellipticals. (3) After these AGN phases and at the highest galaxy masses, maintenance-mode BH feedback into X-ray-emitting gas has the primarily negative effect of helping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas and thereby keeping galaxy formation from going to completion. This happens in giant, core-nonrotating-boxy ellipticals. Their properties, including their tight correlations between [Formula: see text] and core parameters, support the conclusion that core ellipticals form by dissipationless major mergers. They inherit coevolution effects from smaller progenitor galaxies. Also, (4) independent of any feedback physics, in BH growth modes 2 and 3, the averaging that results from successive mergers plays a major role in decreasing the scatter in [Formula: see text] correlations from the large values observed in bulgeless and pseudobulge galaxies to the small values observed in giant elliptical galaxies.},

total {HI} mass. We use the disc flattening to estimate the disc
contribution to the maximum rotational velocity, resulting in an average
of 57 +/- 22 per cent. The disc light distributions are further
investigated for the presence of radial truncations. We find that the
radial light distributions of at least 20 spirals are truncated,
corresponding to 60 per cent of the sample. For small scalelength
spirals, which are the most numerous in the local Universe, the results
suggest that the average ratio of disc truncation radius to disc
scalelength is at least four.},

	abstract = {A universal initial mass function {(IMF)} is not intuitive, but so far no
convincing evidence for a variable {IMF} exists. The detection of
systematic variations of the {IMF} with star-forming conditions would be
the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or
Galactic-field {IMF} is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a
change in the power-law index at only two masses: near
{0.5Msolar} and near {0.08Msolar.} Using this supposed
universal {IMF,} the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of
the {IMF} is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson
noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that
this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in
power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit
within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of
evidence for a variable {IMF} means that any true variation of the {IMF} in
well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter.
Determinations of the power-law indices α are subject to
systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The
systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star
{IMFs} for young star clusters are systematically steeper by
Δα{\textasciitilde}0.5 between 0.1 and {1Msolar} than the
Galactic-field {IMF,} which is populated by, on average, about {5-Gyr-old}
stars. The {MFs} in globular clusters appear to be, on average,
systematically flatter than the Galactic-field {IMF} {(Piotto} \&
Zoccali; Paresce \& De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient
white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of
associated low-mass stars {(Ibata} et al.; Méndez \& Minniti)
suggest a radically different {IMF} for this ancient population. Star
formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce
relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an
interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the
{IMF} as expected from theoretical arguments.},

feedback determines the properties of the molecular clouds that form,
which are nearly independent of galaxy properties until the galactic
interstellar medium {(ISM)} pressure becomes comparable to the internal
giant molecular cloud {(GMC)} pressure. Above this limit, galactic {ISM}
pressure determines molecular gas properties. Third, the turbulence
driven by feedback processes in {GMCs} makes star formation slow, allowing
a small fraction of the gas to be converted to stars per free-fall time
within the molecular clouds. We combine analytic estimates for each of
these steps to formulate a single star formation law, and show that the
predicted correlation between {SFR,} metallicity, and surface densities of
atomic, molecular, and total gas agree well with observations.},

with the analytical description of the merging histories of dark matter
haloes presented in Lacey \& Cole, which is based on an extension of
the Press-Schechter method. We find the analytical predictions for the
halo mass function, merger rates and formation times to be remarkably
accurate. The N-body simulations used 128{\textasciicircum}3{\textasciicircum} particles and were of self-
similar clustering, with {\{OMEGA\}} = 1 and initial power spectra P (k) is
proportional to k{\textasciicircum}n{\textasciicircum}, with spectral indices n = - 2, -1,0. The
analytical model is, however, expected to apply for arbitrary {\{OMEGA\}}
and more general power spectra. Dark matter haloes were identified in
the simulations using two different methods and at a range of
overdensities. For haloes selected at mean overdensities {\textasciitilde}100-200, the
analytical mass function was found to provide a good fit to the
simulations with a collapse threshold close to that predicted by the
spherical collapse model, with a typical error of {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 30 per cent over
a range of 10{\textasciicircum}3{\textasciicircum} in mass, which is the full dynamical range of our
N-body simulation. This was insensitive to the type of filtering used.
Over a range of 10{\textasciicircum}2{\textasciicircum}- 10{\textasciicircum}3{\textasciicircum} in mass, there was also good agreement with
the analytical predictions for merger rates including their dependence
on the masses of the two haloes involved and the time interval being
considered, and for formation times, including the dependence on halo
mass and formation epoch. The analytical Press-Schechter mass function
and its extension to halo lifetimes and merger rates thus provide a very
useful description of the growth of dark matter haloes through
hierarchical clustering, and should provide a valuable tool in studies
of the formation and evolution of galaxies and galaxy clusters.},

	abstract = {We present a new version of the GALFORM semi-analytical model of galaxy formation. This brings together several previous developments of GALFORM into a single unified model, including a different initial mass function (IMF) in quiescent star formation and in starbursts, feedback from active galactic nuclei suppressing gas cooling in massive haloes, and a new empirical star formation law in galaxy discs based on their molecular gas content. In addition, we have updated the cosmology, introduced a more accurate treatment of dynamical friction acting on satellite galaxies, and updated the stellar population model. The new model is able to simultaneously explain both the observed evolution of the K-band luminosity function and stellar mass function, and the number counts and redshift distribution of sub-mm galaxies selected at 850 μm. This was not previously achieved by a single physical model within the Λcold dark matter framework, but requires having an IMF in starbursts that is somewhat top-heavy. The new model is tested against a wide variety of observational data covering wavelengths from the far-UV to sub-mm, and redshifts from z = 0 to 6, and is found to be generally successful. These observations include the optical and near-infrared (IR) luminosity functions, H I mass function, fraction of early type galaxies, Tully-Fisher, metallicity-luminosity and size-luminosity relations at z = 0, as well as far-IR number counts, and far-UV luminosity functions at z ∼ 3-6. Discrepancies are, however, found in galaxy sizes and metallicities at low luminosities, and in the abundance of low-mass galaxies at high-z, suggesting the need for a more sophisticated model of supernova feedback.},

In this work we
develop a semianalytical approach based on the halo model to describe the phase-space distribution and the line-of-sight velocity dispersion for different tracers. The model distinguishes contributions from the halo pairwise velocity and the virial velocity within halos. We also discuss observational complications, in particular the contribution from Hubble flow, and show how our model can incorporate these complications. We then incorporate the effects of modified gravity [specifically, f(R) and braneworld models], and show that the model predictions are in excellent agreement with modified gravity simulations. More broadly, the phase-space distribution provides a sensitive test of our understanding of hierarchical structure formation when confronted with observations via this model.},

	abstract = {High-resolution {(HR)} N-body resimulations of 15 massive (1014-1015 Msolar) dark matter {(DM)} haloes have been combined with the hybrid galaxy formation model {GALICS} to study the formation and evolution of galaxies in clusters, within the framework of the hierarchical merging scenario. This paper describes the {HR} resimulation technique used to build the {DM} halo sample and discusses its reliability. New features incorporated in {GALICS} include a better description of galaxy positioning after {DM} halo merger events, a more reliable computation of the temperature of the intergalactic medium as a function of redshift, which also takes into account the reionization history of the Universe, and a semi-analytic description of the ram pressure stripping of cold gas from galactic discs, suffered by galaxies during their motion through the diffuse hot intracluster medium. Within the multitude of available model results, we choose to focus here on the luminosity functions {(LFs),} morphological fractions and colour distributions of galaxies in clusters and in cluster outskirts, at z= 0. No systematic dependence on cluster richness is found either for the galaxy {LFs,} morphological mixes, or colour distributions. Moving from higher density (cluster cores) to lower density environments (cluster outskirts), we detect a progressive flattening of the {LFs,} an increase of the fraction of spirals and a decrease of that of ellipticals and S0s, and the progressive emergence of a bluer tail in the distributions of galaxy colours, especially for spirals. As compared with cluster spirals, early-type galaxies show a flatter {LF,} and more homogeneous and redder colours. An overall good agreement is found between our results and the observations, particularly in terms of the cluster {LFs} and morphological mixes. However, some discrepancies are also apparent, with too faint magnitudes of the brightest cluster members, especially in the B band, and galaxy colours tending to be too red (or not blue enough) in the model, with respect to the observations. Finally, ram pressure stripping appears to affect very little our results.},

	abstract = {Many of the most exciting questions in astrophysics and cosmology, including the majority of observational probes of dark energy, rely on an understanding of the nonlinear regime of structure formation. In order to fully exploit the information available from this regime and to extract cosmological constraints, accurate theoretical predictions are needed. Currently, such predictions can only be obtained from costly, precision numerical simulations. This paper is the third in a series aimed at constructing an accurate calibration of the nonlinear mass power spectrum on Mpc scales for a wide range of currently viable cosmological models, including dark energy models with w ≠ -1. The first two papers addressed the numerical challenges and the scheme by which an interpolator was built from a carefully chosen set of cosmological models. In this paper, we introduce the {"Coyote} Universe" simulation suite which comprises nearly 1000 N-body simulations at different force and mass resolutions, spanning 38 w {CDM} cosmologies. This large simulation suite enables us to construct a prediction scheme, or emulator, for the nonlinear matter power spectrum accurate at the percent level out to k {\textasciitilde}= 1 h Mpc-1. We describe the construction of the emulator, explain the tests performed to ensure its accuracy, and discuss how the central ideas may be extended to a wider range of cosmological models and applications. A power spectrum emulator code is released publicly as part of this paper.},

	abstract = {Using data from the {COSMOS} survey, we perform the first joint analysis of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy number densities. Carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter between stellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using a novel and self-consistent theoretical framework. Our results provide strong constraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass relation {(SHMR)} from z=0.2 to z=1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass scales as Mh M*{\textasciicircum}0.46 and that this scaling does not evolve significantly with redshift to z=1. We show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, {Mh/M*}, varies from low to high masses, reaching a minimum of {Mh/M*{\textasciitilde}27} at M*=4.5x10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun and Mh=1.2x10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun. This minimum is important for models of galaxy formation because it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the central galaxy has been the most efficient. We describe the {SHMR} at this minimum in terms of the "pivot stellar mass", M*piv, the "pivot halo mass", Mhpiv, and the "pivot ratio", {(Mh/M*)piv.} Thanks to a homogeneous analysis of a single data set, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends for both Mhpiv and M*piv. The pivot stellar mass decreases from M*piv=5.75+-0.13x10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun at z=0.88 to M*piv=3.55+-0.17x10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun at z=0.37. Intriguingly, however, the corresponding evolution of Mhpiv leaves the pivot ratio constant with redshift at {(Mh/M*)piv{\textasciitilde}27.} We use simple arguments to show how this result raises the possibility that star formation quenching may ultimately depend on {Mh/M*} and not simply Mh, as is commonly assumed. We show that simple models with such a dependence naturally lead to downsizing in the sites of star formation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in the context of popular quenching models, including disk instabilities and {AGN} feedback.},

I maps from The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey {(THINGS)} and derive
H2 maps of {CO} measured by {HERA} {CO-Line} Extragalactic Survey
and {Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland} Association Survey of Nearby Galaxies. We
estimate the {SFR} by combining Galaxy Evolution Explorer {(GALEX)}
far-ultraviolet maps and the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey
{(SINGS)} 24 μm maps, infer stellar surface density profiles from {SINGS}
3.6 μm data, and use kinematics from {THINGS.} We measure the {SFE} as a
function of the free fall and orbital timescales, midplane gas pressure,
stability of the gas disk to collapse (including the effects of stars),
the ability of perturbations to grow despite shear, and the ability of a
cold phase to form. In spirals, the {SFE} of H2 alone is nearly
constant at (5.25 ± 2.5) × 10-10
yr-1 (equivalent to an H2 depletion time of
1.9 × 109 yr) as a function of all of these variables
at our 800 pc resolution. Where the interstellar medium {(ISM)} is mostly
H I, however, the {SFE} decreases with increasing radius in both spiral
and dwarf galaxies, a decline reasonably described by an exponential
with scale length 0.2r 25-0.25r 25. We interpret
this decline as a strong dependence of giant molecular cloud {(GMC)}
formation on environment. The ratio of molecular-to-atomic gas appears
to be a smooth function of radius, stellar surface density, and pressure
spanning from the H2-dominated to H I-dominated {ISM.} The
radial decline in {SFE} is too steep to be reproduced only by increases in
the free-fall time or orbital time. Thresholds for large-scale
instability suggest that our disks are stable or marginally stable and
do not show a clear link to the declining {SFE.} We suggest that {ISM}
physics below the scales that we observe—phase balance in the H I,
H2 formation and destruction, and stellar
feedback—governs the formation of {GMCs} from H I.},

-1.155. For a standard cosmology and a standard stellar initial mass
function, only 3.5 per cent of the baryons in the low-redshift Universe
are locked up in stars. The projected autocorrelation function of
stellar mass is robustly and precisely determined for rp {\textless}
{30h-1Mpc.} Over the range 10h-1kpc {\textless}
rp {\textless} {10h-1Mpc,} it is extremely well represented
by a power law. The corresponding three-dimensional autocorrelation
function is ξ*(r) = {(r/6.1h-1Mpc)-1.84.}
Relative to the dark matter, the bias of the stellar mass distribution
is approximately constant on large scales, but varies by a factor of 5
for rp {\textless} {1h-1Mpc.} This behaviour is
approximately but not perfectly reproduced by current models for galaxy
formation in the concordance Λcold dark matter cosmology.
Detailed comparison suggests that a fluctuation amplitude
σ8 {\textasciitilde} 0.8 is preferred to the somewhat larger value
adopted in the Millennium Simulation models with which we compare our

We adopt three models for the internal kinematics: isotropic velocities, constant anisotropy and increasingly radial Osipkov-Merritt anisotropy. Analytical solutions are found for the radial dependence of the mass, gravitational potential, velocity dispersion, energy and virial ratio and we test their variability with the concentration parameter describing the density profile and amount of velocity anisotropy. We also compute structural parameters, such as half-mass radius, effective radius and various measures of concentration. Finally, we derive projected quantities, the surface mass density and line-of-sight as well as aperture-velocity dispersion, all of which can be directly applied in observational tests of current scenarios of structure formation. On the mass scales of galaxies, if constant mass-to-light is assumed, the NFW surface density profile is found to fit Hubble-Reynolds laws well. It is also well fitted by Sérsic R1/m laws, for  but in a much narrower range of m and with much larger effective radii than are observed.

Using a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations of MW-mass halos with a fixed final \{M\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}\{vir{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}\}̃ \{10\}{\textless}SUP{\textgreater}12.1{\textless}/SUP{\textgreater} \{M\}{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}☉ {\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}, we find that the presence of Magellanic Cloud-like satellites strongly correlates with the assembly history, concentration, and subhalo population of the host halo, such that MW-mass systems with Magellanic Clouds have lower concentration, more rapid recent accretion, and more massive subhalos than typical halos of the same mass. Using a flexible semi-analytic galaxy formation model that is tuned to reproduce the stellar mass function of the classical dwarf galaxies of the MW with Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo, we show that adopting host halos with different mass-assembly histories and concentrations can lead to different best-fit models for galaxy-formation physics, especially for the strength of feedback. These biases arise because the presence of the Magellanic Clouds boosts the overall population of high-mass subhalos, thus requiring a different stellar-mass-to-halo-mass ratio to match the data. These biases also lead to significant differences in the mass-metallicity relation, the kinematics of low-mass satellites, the number counts of small satellites associated with the Magellanic Clouds, and the stellar mass of MW itself. Observations of these galaxy properties can thus provide useful constraints on the properties of the MW halo.},

We extend earlier work on the relation between halo mass profiles and assembly histories to show how the latter may be used to predict concentrations for haloes of all masses and at any redshift. Our results clarify the link between concentration and the `collapse redshift' of a halo as well as why concentration depends on mass and redshift solely through the dimensionless `peak height' mass parameter, ν(M, z) = δcrit(z)/σ(M, z). We combine these
results with analytic mass accretion histories to extrapolate the c(M, z) relations to mass regimes difficult to reach through direct
simulation. Our model predicts that, at given z, c(M) should deviate systematically from a simple power law at high masses, where
concentrations approach a constant value, and at low masses, where concentrations are substantially lower than expected from extrapolating published empirical fits. This correction may reduce the expected self-annihilation boost factor from substructure by about one order of magnitude. The model also reproduces the c(M, z) dependence on
cosmological parameters reported in earlier work and thus provides a simple and robust account of the relation between cosmology and the mass-concentration-redshift relation of CDM haloes.},

mass-concentration-redshift relation, c(M, z), of dark matter haloes. Our simulations include standard Λ-cold dark matter (CDM) models, and additional runs with truncated power spectra, consistent with a thermal warm dark matter (WDM) scenario. We find that the mass profiles of CDM and WDM haloes are self-similar and well approximated by the Einasto profile. The c(M, z) relation of CDM haloes is monotonic: concentrations decrease with increasing virial mass at fixed redshift, and decrease with increasing redshift at fixed mass. The mass accretion histories (MAHs) of CDM haloes are also scale-free, and can be used to infer concentrations directly. These results do not apply to WDM haloes: their MAHs are not scale-free because of the characteristic scale imposed by the power spectrum suppression. Further, the WDM c(M, z) relation is non-monotonic: concentrations peak at a mass scale dictated by the truncation scale, and decrease at higher and lower masses. We show that the assembly history of a halo can still be used to infer its concentration, provided that the total mass of its progenitors is considered (the `collapsed mass history'; CMH), rather than just that of its main ancestor. This exploits the scale-free nature of CMHs to derive a simple scaling that reproduces the mass-concentration-redshift relation of both CDM and WDM haloes over a vast range of halo masses and redshifts. Our model therefore provides a robust account of the mass, redshift, cosmology and power spectrum dependence of dark matter halo concentrations.},

As part of the {\em COpernicus COmplexio} (\textsc{coco}) programme, we investigate the properties of dark matter haloes formed in a high-resolution cosmological $N$-body simulation from initial conditions similar to those expected in a universe in which the dark matter consists of 7~keV sterile neutrinos. This simulation and its cold dark matter (CDM) counterpart have $\sim13.4$bn particles, each of mass $\sim 10^5\,\Msun$, providing detailed information about halo structure and evolution down to dwarf galaxy mass scales.  Non-linear structure formation on small scales ($M_{200}\, \lsim\, 2 \times 10^9~h^{-1}\,M_\odot$) begins slightly later in \textsc{coco-warm} than in \textsc{coco-cold}.  The halo mass function at the present day in the WDM model begins to drop below its CDM counterpart at a mass $\sim 2 \times 10^{9}~h^{-1}\,M_\odot$ and declines very rapidly towards lower masses so that there are five times fewer haloes of mass $M_{200}= 10^{8}~h^{-1}\,M_\odot$ in \textsc{coco-warm} than in \textsc{coco-cold}.  Halo concentrations on dwarf galaxy scales are correspondingly smaller in \textsc{coco-warm}, and we provide a simple functional form that describes its evolution with redshift. The shapes of haloes are similar in the two cases, but the smallest haloes in \textsc{coco-warm} rotate slightly more slowly than their CDM counterparts.}

lines, such as Lyman alpha, Lyman beta, Lyman gamma, and higher order
members, and Lyman-continuum absorption. Both the numerous, optically
thin Lyman-alpha forest clouds and the rarer, optically thick Lyman
limit systems are found to contribute to the obscuration of background
sources. We study the mean properties of primeval galaxies at high
redshift in four broad optical passbands, Un, B, G, and R.
Even if young galaxies radiated a significant amount of ionizing
photons, the attenuation due to the accumulated photoelectric opacity
along the path is so severe that sources beyond z approximately 3 will
drop out of the Un image together. We also show that the
observed {B-R} color of distant galaxies can be much redder than expected
from a stellar population. At z approximately 3.5, the blanketing by
discrete absorption lines in the Lyman series is so effective that
background galaxies appear, on average, 1 mag fainter in B. By z
approximately 4, the observed B magnitude increment due to intergalactic
absorption exceeds 2 mag. By modeling the intrinsic {UV} spectral energy
distribution of star-forming galaxies with a stellar population
synthesis code, we show that the {(B-R)AB} approximately 0
criterion for identifying 'flat-spectrum,' metal-producing galaxies is
biased against objects at z greater than 3. The continuum blanketing
from the Lyman series produces a characteristic staircase profile in the
transmitted power. We suggest that this cosmic Lyman decrement might be
used as a tool to identify high-z galaxies.},

We focus on the origin of assembly bias in the mass range corresponding to the hosts of typical galaxies and use halo concentration as our chief proxy of halo formation time. We also repeat our key analyses across a broad range of halo masses and for alternative formation time definitions. We show that splashback subhaloes are responsible for two-thirds of the assembly bias signal, but do not account for the entire effect. After splashback subhaloes have been removed, we find that the remaining assembly bias signal is due to a relatively small fraction ( \${\textbackslash}lesssim {\textbackslash}!10\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ ) of haloes in dense regions. We test a number of additional physical processes thought to contribute to assembly bias and demonstrate that the two key processes are the slowing of mass growth by large-scale tidal fields and by the high velocities of ambient matter in sheets and filaments. We also rule out several other proposed physical causes of halo assembly bias. Based on our results, we argue that there are three processes that modify the assembly bias of small-mass haloes arising from the properties of the primordial Gaussian field: large-scale tidal fields, gravitational heating due to the collapse of large-scale structures, and splashback subhaloes located outside the virial radius.},

near-infrared {(IR)} spectral line indices. The energetics of the post
main sequence evolutionary phases are evaluated with the fuel
consumption theorem. The impact on the models of the stellar
evolutionary tracks (in particular with and without overshooting) is
assessed. We find modest differences in synthetic broad-band colours as
induced by the use of different tracks in our code [e.g. {Δ(V-K)} {\textasciitilde}
0.08 mag, {Δ(B-V)} {\textasciitilde} 0.03 mag]. Noticeably, these differences are
substantially smaller than the scatter among other models in the
literature, even when the latter adopt the same evolutionary tracks. The
models are calibrated with globular cluster data from the Milky Way for
old ages, and the Magellanic clouds plus the merger remnant galaxy {NGC}
7252, both for young ages of {{\textasciitilde}0.1-2Gyr,} in a large wavelength range from
the U band to the K band. Particular emphasis is put on the contribution
from the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch {(TP-AGB)} phase. We
show that this evolutionary phase is crucial for the modelling of young
stellar populations by direct comparison with observed spectral energy
distributions of Magellanic cloud clusters, which are characterized by
relatively high fluxes, both blueward and redward of the V band. We find
that the combination of the {near-IR} spectral indices C2 and
{H2O} can be used to determine the metallicity of {\textasciitilde}1 Gyr

Our best-fitting power-law relations for the full galaxy sample are log10(M •) = 8.32 + 5.64log10(σ/200 km s-1), log10(M •) = 9.23 + 1.11log10(L/1011 L ⊙), and log10(M •) = 8.46 + 1.05log10(M bulge/1011 M ⊙). A log-quadratic fit to the M •-σ relation with an additional term of β2 [log10(σ/200 km s-1)]2 gives β2 = 1.68 ± 1.82 and does not decrease the intrinsic scatter in M •. Including 92 additional upper limits on M • does not change the slope of the M •-σ relation. When the early- and late-type galaxies are fit separately, we obtain similar slopes of 5.20 and 5.06 for the M •-σ relation but significantly different intercepts—M • in early-type galaxies are about two times higher than in late types at a given sigma. Within early-type galaxies, our fits to M •(σ) give M • that is about two times higher in galaxies with central core profiles than those with central power-law profiles. Our M •-L and M •-M bulge relations for early-type galaxies are similar to those from earlier compilations, and core and power-law galaxies yield similar L- and M bulge-based predictions for M •. When the conventional quadrature method is used to determine the intrinsic scatter in M •, our data set shows weak evidence for increased scatter at M bulge {\textless} 1011 M ⊙ or LV {\textless} 1010.3 L ⊙, while the scatter stays constant for 1011 {\textless} M bulge {\textless} 1012.3 M ⊙ and 1010.3 {\textless} LV {\textless} 1011.5 L ⊙.

	abstract = {A model is presented in which the strongest radio-emitting jet outflows
are produced in black hole systems when the accretion is a geometrically
thick {(H/R{\textasciitilde}1)} inflow (e.g., an advection-dominated or a
convection-dominated accretion flow) and if the black hole is rotating.
For galactic black hole candidates, the model naturally accounts for the
observed correlation of jet outflow with the black hole hard emission
state and predicts an association of strong jets with rapid black hole
rotation. When extended to the supermassive case, the model accounts for
the highest radio galaxy and quasar jet powers and provides additional
theoretical support for the ``spin paradigm,'' which asserts that
radio-loud quasars are produced by Kerr holes and radio-quiet ones by
Schwarzschild holes. In some cases, the angular momentum and energy
outflow in the jet may be large enough to alter significantly the
structure of the accretion flow from that predicted by current models.},

using a semi-analytical model of galaxy formation, applied to the halo
merger trees extracted from a cosmological N-body simulation. The mocks
that we construct are lightcone catalogues, in which a galaxy is placed
according to the epoch at which it first enters the past lightcone of
the observer, and incorporate the evolution of galaxy properties with
cosmic time. We determine the position between the snapshot outputs at
which a galaxy enters the observer's lightcone by interpolation. As an
application, we consider the effectiveness of the BzK colour selection
technique, which was designed to isolate galaxies in the redshift
interval 1.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5. The mock catalogue is in reasonable
agreement with the observed number counts of all BzK galaxies, as well
as with the observed counts of the subsample of BzKs that are
star-forming galaxies. We predict that over 75 per cent of the model
galaxies with KAB ≤ 23, and 1.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5, are
selected by the BzK technique. Interloper galaxies, outside the intended
redshift range, are predicted to dominate bright samples of BzK galaxies
(i.e. with KAB ≤ 21). Fainter K-band cuts are necessary to
reduce the predicted interloper fraction. We also show that shallow
B-band photometry can lead to confusion in classifying BzK galaxies as
being star forming or passively evolving. Overall, we conclude that the
BzK colour selection technique is capable of providing a sample of
galaxies that is representative of the 1.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 galaxy
population.},

	abstract = {We develop a simple analytic model for the gravitational clustering of
dark matter haloes to understand how their spatial distribution is
biased relative to that of the mass. The statistical distribution of
dark haloes within the initial density field (assumed Gaussian) is
determined by an extension of the {Press-Schechter} formalism.
Modifications of this distribution caused by gravitationally induced
motions are treated using a spherical collapse approximation. We test
this model against results from a variety of N-body simulations, and
find that it gives an accurate description of a bias function, {b(M,} R,
{delta)=delta\_h(M,} R, delta)/delta, where {delta\_h(M,} R, delta) is the
mean overdensity of haloes of mass M within spheres which have radius R
and mass overdensity delta the results depend only very weakly on how
haloes are identified in the simulations. This bias function is
sufficient to calculate the cross-correlation between dark haloes and
mass, and again we find excellent agreement between simulation results
and analytic predictions. Because haloes are spatially exclusive, the
variance in the count of objects within spheres of fixed radius and
overdensity is significantly smaller than the Poisson value. This
seriously complicates any analytic calculation of the autocorrelation
function of dark haloes. Our simulation results show, however, that this
autocorrelation function is proportional to that of the mass over a wide
range in R, even including scales where both functions are significantly
greater than unity. Furthermore, the constant of proportionality is very
close to that predicted on large scales by the analytic model. Since
analytic formulae for the non-linear autocorrelation function of the
mass are already known, this result permits an entirely analytic
estimate of the autocorrelation function of dark haloes. We use our
model to study how the distribution of galaxies may be biased with
respect to that of the mass. In conjunction with other data these
techniques should make it possible to measure the amplitude of cosmic
mass fluctuations and the density of the Universe.},

	abstract = {We study the population of galactic discs expected in current 
hierarchical clustering models for structure formation. A rotationally 
supported disc with exponential surface density profile is assumed to 
form with a mass and angular momentum which are fixed fractions of those 
of its surrounding dark halo. We assume that haloes respond 
adiabatically to disc formation, and that only stable discs can 
correspond to real systems. With these assumptions the predicted 
population can match both present-day discs and the damped Lyalpha 
absorbers in {QSO} spectra. Good agreement is found provided that: (i) the 
masses of discs are a few per cent of those of their haloes; (ii) the 
specific angular momenta of discs are similar to those of their haloes; 
(iii) present-day discs were assembled recently (at z{\textless}=1). In 
particular, the observed scatter in the size-rotation velocity plane is 
reproduced, as are the slope and scatter of the Tully-Fisher {(TF)} 
relation. The zero-point of the {TF} relation is matched for a stellar 
mass-to-light ratio of 1 to 2 h in the I-band, consistent with 
observational values derived from disc dynamics. High-redshift discs are 
predicted to be small and dense, and could plausibly merge together to 
form the observed population of elliptical galaxies. In many (but not 
all) currently popular cosmogonies, discs with rotation velocities 
exceeding 200 kms{\textasciicircum}-1 can account for a third or more of the observed 
damped Lyalpha systems at z{\textasciitilde}2.5. Half of the lines of sight to such 
systems are predicted to intersect the absorber at r{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}3h{\textasciicircum}-1kpc and 
about 10 per cent at r{\textgreater}10h{\textasciicircum}-1kpc. The cross-section for absorption is 
strongly weighted towards discs with large angular momentum and 
therefore large size for their mass. The galaxy population associated 
with damped absorbers should thus be biased towards low surface 
brightness systems.},

dwarf `little blue spheroid' class, which is not obviously similar in
structure to either classical spheroid or disc populations. We also
examine the variation of component mass ratios across galaxy mass and
group halo mass regimes, finding the transition from spheroid to disc

	abstract = {We present the Model for the Rise of Galaxies and Active Nuclei {(MORGANA),} a new code for the formation and evolution of galaxies and active galactic nuclei {(AGNs).} Starting from the merger trees of dark matter {(DM)} haloes and a model for the evolution of substructure within the haloes, the complex physics of baryons is modelled with a set of state-of-the-art models that describe the mass, metal and energy flows between the various components (baryonic halo, bulge, disc) and phases (cold and hot gas, stars) of a galaxy. These flows are then numerically integrated to produce predictions for the evolution of galaxies. The processes of shock-heating and cooling, star formation, feedback, galactic winds and superwinds, accretion on to black holes and {AGN} feedback are described by new models. In particular, the evolution of the halo gas explicitly follows the thermal and kinetic energies of the hot and cold phases, while star formation and feedback follow the results of the multiphase model recently proposed by Monaco. The increased level of sophistication of these models allows to move from a phenomenological description of gas physics, based on simple scalings with the depth of the {DM} halo potential, towards a fully physically motivated one. We deem that this is fully justified by the level of maturity and rough convergence reached by the latest versions of numerical and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. The comparison of the predictions of {MORGANA} with a basic set of galactic data reveals from the one hand an overall rough agreement, and from the other hand highlights a number of well- or less-known problems: (i) producing the cut-off of the luminosity function requires to force the quenching of the late cooling flows by {AGN} feedback, (ii) the normalization of the {Tully-Fisher} relation of local spirals cannot be recovered unless the {DM} haloes are assumed to have a very low concentration, (iii) the mass function of {HI} gas is not easily fitted at small masses, unless a similarly low concentration is assumed, (iv) there is an excess of small elliptical galaxies at z = 0. These discrepancies, more than the points of agreement with data, give important clues on the missing ingredients of galaxy formation.},

Thanks to the SDSS DR6, galaxy statistics have increased by a factor of {\textasciitilde}7 in the u band and by a factor between {\textasciitilde}3 and {\textasciitilde}5 in the rest of the SDSS bands with respect to the previous work of Blanton et al. In addition, we have ensured a high redshift completeness in our galaxy samples, mainly by minimizing the effect of brightness-dependent incompleteness. With these advances, we have estimated very accurate SDSS DR6 LFs at both the bright and the faint end. In the 0.1r band, our LF is well fitted by a Schechter LF with parameters Φ* = 0.93 +/- 0.07,M* - 5log10h = -20.71 +/- 0.04 and α = -1.26 +/- 0.02. As compared with previous results, we find some notable differences. At the bright end of the 0.1u-band LF we find a remarkable excess, of {\textasciitilde}1.7dex at , with respect to the best-fitting Schechter LF. This excess weakens in the 0.1g band, fading away towards the very red 0.1z band. A preliminary analysis on the nature of this bright-end bump reveals that it is composed of quasi-stellar objects/type 1 Seyferts ({\textasciitilde}60per cent), starbursts and star-forming galaxies ({\textasciitilde}20 per cent) and normal galaxies ({\textasciitilde}20 per cent). It seems, therefore, that an important fraction of this excess
luminosity may come from nuclear activity. At the faint end of the SDSS DR6 LFs, where we can reach 0.5-1mag deeper than the previous SDSS LF estimations, we obtain a steeper slope that increases from the
0.1u band, with α = -1.05 +/- 0.05, to the very red
0.1z band, with α = -1.26 +/- 0.03. We have also
investigated the effect of galaxy evolution on our LFs. These
state-of-the-art results may be used to constrain a variety of aspects of star formation histories and/or feedback processes in galaxy
formation models.},

In order to maximally extract cosmological information from these observations, matching theoretical predictions are needed. At low redshifts, the surveys probe the non-linear regime of structure formation where cosmological simulations are the primary means of obtaining the required information. The computational cost of sufficiently resolved large-volume simulations makes it prohibitive to run very large ensembles. Nevertheless, precision emulators built on a tractable number of high-quality simulations can be used to build very fast prediction schemes to enable a variety of cosmological inference studies. We have recently introduced the Mira-Titan Universe simulation suite designed to construct emulators for a range of cosmological probes. This gravity-only set of simulations covers the standard six cosmological parameters \{ωm, ωb, σ8, h, ns, w0\} and, in addition, includes massive neutrinos and a dynamical dark energy equation of state \{ων, wa\}. In this paper, we present the final emulator for the matter power spectrum based on 111 cosmological simulations, each covering a (2.1 Gpc)3 volume and evolving 32003 particles. An additional set of 1776 lower resolution simulations and TimeRG perturbation theory results for the power spectrum are used to cover scales straddling the linear to mildly non-linear regimes (maximum wavenumber k = 5 Mpc-1). The emulator provides predictions at the 2-3 per cent level of accuracy over a wide range of cosmological parameters and is publicly released as part of this paper.},

depends upon the linking length parameter, b. We show that for the
commonly used choice of b = 0.2, this critical density is equal to 81.62
times the mean matter density. Consequently, halos identified by the {FOF}
algorithm enclose an average overdensity which depends on their density
profile (concentration) and therefore changes with halo mass, contrary
to the popular belief that the average overdensity is {\textasciitilde}180. We derive an
analytical expression for the overdensity as a function of the linking
length parameter b and the concentration of the halo. Results of tests
carried out using simulated and actual {FOF} halos identified in
cosmological simulations show excellent agreement with our analytical
prediction. We also find that the mass of the halo that the {FOF}
algorithm selects crucially depends upon mass resolution. We find a
percolation-theory-motivated formula that is able to accurately correct
for the dependence on number of particles for the mock realizations of
spherical and triaxial Navarro-Frenk-White halos. However, we show that
this correction breaks down when applied to the real cosmological {FOF}
halos due to the presence of substructures. Given that abundance of
substructure depends on redshift and cosmology, we expect that the
resolution effects due to substructure on the {FOF} mass and halo mass
function will also depend on redshift and cosmology and will be
difficult to correct for in general. Finally, we discuss the
implications of our results for the universality of the mass function.},

systematic errors in our evolutionary measurements. We find that the {SMF}
of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z = 1, although we do
find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a ≈30\%
increase in the number density of {\textasciitilde}1010 {\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot} \}

of all {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 1011 {\{M\}\_\{{\textbackslash}odot} \} galaxies since z ≈ 1.
Dividing the sample into star-forming and quiescent using an evolving

toward low redshift, by a factor of {\textasciitilde}2-3 since z ≈ 0.6, while the
number of massive quiescent galaxies remains approximately constant
since z ≈ 1. These results suggest that the rate at which
star-forming galaxies are quenched increases with decreasing stellar
mass, but that the bulk of the stellar mass buildup within the quiescent

	abstract = {Structure formation at small cosmological scales provides an important frontier for dark matter (DM) research. Scenarios with small DM particle masses, large momenta or hidden interactions tend to suppress the gravitational clustering at small scales. The details of this
suppression depend on the DM particle nature, allowing for a direct link between DM models and astrophysical observations. However, most of the astrophysical constraints obtained so far refer to a very specific shape of the power suppression, corresponding to thermal warm dark matter (WDM), i.e., candidates with a Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein momentum distribution. In this work we introduce a new analytical fitting formula for the power spectrum, which is simple yet flexible enough to reproduce the clustering signal of large classes of non-thermal DM models, which are not at all adequately described by the oversimplified notion of WDM . We show that the formula is able to fully cover the parameter space of sterile neutrinos (whether resonantly produced or from particle decay), mixed cold and warm models, fuzzy dark matter, as well as other models suggested by effective theory of structure formation (ETHOS). Based on this fitting formula, we perform a large suite of N-body simulations and we extract important nonlinear statistics, such as the matter power spectrum and the halo mass function. Finally, we present first
preliminary astrophysical constraints, based on linear theory, from both the number of Milky Way satellites and the Lyman-α forest. This
paper is a first step towards a general and comprehensive modeling of small-scale departures from the standard cold DM model.},

star-forming and quiescent galaxies to z = 4 using a sample of 95,675
Ks -selected galaxies in the {COSMOS}/{UltraVISTA} field. The
{SMFs} of the combined population are in good agreement with previous
measurements and show that the stellar mass density of the universe was
only 50\%, 10\%, and 1\% of its current value at z {\textasciitilde} 0.75, 2.0, and 3.5,
respectively. The quiescent population drives most of the overall
growth, with the stellar mass density of these galaxies increasing as
rhostarvprop(1 + z)-4.7 ± 0.4 since
z = 3.5, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies increases as
rhostarvprop(1 + z)-2.3 ± 0.2. At z
{\textgreater} 2.5, star-forming galaxies dominate the total {SMF} at all stellar
masses, although a non-zero population of quiescent galaxies persists to
z = 4. Comparisons of the Ks -selected star-forming galaxy
{SMFs} with {UV}-selected {SMFs} at 2.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 4 show reasonable
agreement and suggest that {UV}-selected samples are representative of the
majority of the stellar mass density at z {\textgreater} 3.5. We estimate the
average mass growth of individual galaxies by selecting galaxies at
fixed cumulative number density. The average galaxy with log(M
star/M \&sun;) = 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown in
mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0 (3.5), whereas those with
log(M star/M \&sun;) = 10.5 have grown by {\textgreater}1.0
dex since z = 2. At z {\textless} 2, the time derivatives of the mass growth
are always larger for lower-mass galaxies, which demonstrates that the
mass growth in galaxies since that redshift is mass-dependent and
primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of systematic
uncertainties in the {SMFs} and find that those from photo-z templates,
stellar population synthesis modeling, and the definition of quiescent
galaxies dominate the total error budget in the {SMFs}.

	abstract = {We investigate the metal enrichment of the intracluster medium {(ICM)}
within the framework of hierarchical models of galaxy formation. We
calculate the formation and evolution of galaxies and clusters using a
semi-analytical model which includes the effects of flows of gas and
metals both into and out of galaxies. For the first time in a
semi-analytical model, we calculate the production of both α and
iron-peak elements based on theoretical models for the lifetimes and
ejecta of type Ia and {II} supernovae {(SNe} Ia and {II).} It is essential to
include the long lifetimes of the {SNIa} progenitors in order to correctly
model the evolution of the iron-peak elements. We find that if all stars
form with an initial mass function {(IMF)} similar to that found in the
solar neighbourhood, then the metallicities of O, Mg, Si and Fe in the
{ICM} are predicted to be two to three times lower than the observed
values. In contrast, a model (also favoured on other grounds) in which
stars formed in bursts triggered by galaxy mergers have a top-heavy {IMF}
reproduces the observed {ICM} abundances of O, Mg, Si and Fe. The same
model predicts ratios of {ICM} mass to total stellar luminosity in
clusters which agree well with observations. According to our model, the
bulk of the metals in clusters are produced by L* and
brighter galaxies. We predict only mild evolution of {[Fe/H]} in the {ICM}
with redshift out to z{\textasciitilde} 1, consistent with the sparse data available on
high-z clusters. In contrast, the {[O/Fe]} ratio is predicted to gradually
decrease with time because of the delayed production of iron compared
with oxygen. We find that, at a given redshift, the scatter in global
metallicity for clusters of a given mass is quite small, even though the
formation histories of individual clusters show wide variations. The
observed diversity in {ICM} metallicities may thus result from the range
in metallicity gradients induced by the scatter in the assembly
histories of clusters of galaxies.},

Previous calculations predict that the suppression occurs up to a characteristic mass scale of {\textasciitilde}106Msolar, which suggests that pressure has a central role in determining the properties of the first luminous objects at early times. We show that the expected characteristic mass scale is in fact substantially lower (by a factor of {\textasciitilde}3-10, depending on
redshift), and thus the effect of baryonic pressure on the formation of galaxies up to reionization is only moderate. This reduction in the characteristic mass scale is a result of including the fact that the baryons have smoother initial conditions than the dark matter. This smoothing is due to the aftereffects of the coupling with the radiation before recombination. This yields lower pressure gradients than previous estimations in the period from cosmic recombination to z {\textasciitilde} 200, after which the gas cooled down adiabatically and the pressure dropped. At z {\textasciitilde} 10 the suppression of the baryon fluctuations is still sensitive to the history of pressure in this high-redshift era. We calculate the fraction of the cosmic gas that is in minihaloes and find that it is
substantially higher than would be expected with the previously
estimated characteristic mass. Expanding our investigation to the non-linear regime, we calculate in detail the spherical collapse of high-redshift objects in a Lambda cold dark matter universe. We
include the gravitational contributions of the baryons and radiation and the memory of their kinematic coupling before recombination. We use our results to predict a more accurate halo mass function as a function of redshift.},

Such advection-dominated flows may occur when the optical depth is either very small or very large. We obtain a family of self-similar solutions where the temperature of the accreting gas is nearly virial and the flow is quasi-spherical. The gas rotates at much less than the Keplerian angular velocity; therefore, the central stars in such flows will cease to spin up long before they reach the break-up limit. Further, the Bernoulli parameter is positive, implying that advection-dominated flows are susceptible to producing outflows. Convection is likely in many of these flows and, if present, will tend to enhance the above effects. We suggest that advection-dominated accretion may provide an explanation for the slow spin rates of accreting stars and the widespread occurence of outflows and jets in accreting systems.},

	abstract = {We use N-body simulations to investigate the structure of dark halos in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony. Halos are excised from simulations of cosmologically representative regions and are resimulated individually at high resolution. We study objects with masses ranging from those of dwarf galaxy halos to those of rich galaxy clusters. The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple "universal" profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r-2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the {CDM} model. {CDM} halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

	abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the {Press-Schechter} formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

These prescriptions are specially designed for large cosmological simulations, where, given current computational limitations, individual galaxies can only be represented by simplistic model objects with a few global properties. Our recipes allow us to (1) split total cold gas masses between H I, H2, and helium, (2) assign realistic sizes to both the H I and H2 disks, and (3) evaluate the corresponding velocity profiles and shapes of the characteristic radio emission lines. The results presented in this paper include the local H I and H2 mass functions, the {CO} luminosity function, the cold gas mass-diameter relation, and the Tully-Fisher relation ({TFR)}, which all match recent observational data from the local universe. We also present high-redshift predictions of cold gas diameters and the {TFR}, both of which appear to evolve markedly with redshift.},

	abstract = {The abundance of dark matter haloes is one of the key probes of the growth of structure and expansion history of the Universe. Theoretical predictions for this quantity usually assume that, when expressed in a certain form, it depends only on the mass variance of the linear density field. However, cosmological simulations have revealed that this assumption breaks, leading to 10-20 per cent systematic effects. In this paper, we employ a specially designed suite of simulations to further investigate this problem. Specifically, we carry out cosmological N-body simulations where we systematically vary growth history at a fixed linear density field, or vary the power spectrum shape at a fixed growth history. We show that the halo mass function generically depends on these quantities, thus showing a clear signal of non-universality. Most of this effect can be traced back to the way in which the same linear fluctuation grows differently into the non-linear regime depending on details of its assembly history. With these results, we propose a parameterization with explicit dependence on the linear growth rate and power spectrum shape. Using an independent suite of simulations, we show that this fitting function accurately captures the mass function of haloes over cosmologies spanning a vast parameter space, including massive neutrinos and dynamical dark energy. Finally, we employ this tool to improve the accuracy of so-called cosmology-rescaling methods and show they can deliver 2 per cent accurate predictions for the halo mass function over the whole range of currently viable cosmologies.},

	abstract = {We study the spherical collapse model for several dark energy scenarios using the fully nonlinear differential equation for the evolution of the density contrast within homogeneous spherical overdensities derived from Newtonian hydrodynamics. While mathematically equivalent to the more common approach based on the differential equation for the radius of the perturbation, this approach has substantial conceptual as well as numerical advantages. Among the most important are that no singularities at early times appear, which avoids numerical problems in particular in applications to cosmologies with dynamical and early dark energy, and that the assumption of time-reversal symmetry can easily be dropped where it is not strictly satisfied. We use this approach to derive the two parameters characterising the spherical-collapse model, i.e.{\textasciitilde}the linear density threshold for collapse \${\textbackslash}delta\_{\textbackslash}mathrm{c}\$ and the virial overdensity {\${\textbackslash}Delta\_{\textbackslash}mathrm{V}\$,} for a broad variety of dark-energy models and to reconsider these parameters in cosmologies with early dark energy. We find that, independently of the model under investigation, \${\textbackslash}delta\_{\textbackslash}mathrm{c}\$ and {\${\textbackslash}Delta\_{\textbackslash}mathrm{V}\$} are always very close to the values obtained for the standard {\${\textbackslash}Lambda\$CDM} model, arguing that the abundance of and the mean density within non-linear structures are quite insensitive to the differences between dark-energy cosmologies. Regarding early dark energy, we thus arrive at a different conclusion than some earlier papers, including one from our group, and we explain why.},

The nebular emissions (continuum emission, 54 H and He recombination lines and 60 nebular lines from {UV} to {IR}) have been computed with {CLOUDY} and then included into {GRASIL}, our spectrophotometric code specifically developed for dusty galaxies. The interface between nebular emission and population synthesis is based on a set of pre-computed H {II} region emission models covering a wide range of physical quantities (metallicity, density, geometry and number of H I, He I and O {II} ionizing photons). These quantities are fully adequate to describe the emission properties of the majority of star-forming and starburst galaxies. Concerning the extinction properties of normal star forming galaxies, we are able to interpret the observed lack of correlation between the attenuation measured at Hα and in the {UV} band as a consequence of age selective extinction. We also find that, for these galaxies with modest {SFR}, the ratio {FIR}/{UV} provides the best constraints on the {UV} attenuation. The accurate treatment of lines and continuum in dusty galaxies also allows to deal with different {SFR} estimators in a consistent way, from the {UV} to radio wavelengths, and to discuss the uncertainties arising from the different physical conditions encountered in star forming galaxies. We provide our best estimates of {SFR}/luminosity calibrations, together with their expected range of variation. It results that {SFR} derived through Hα , even when corrected for extinction using the Balmer decrement, is affected by important uncertainties due to age selective extinction. Another remarkable result is that {SFR} from {UV} luminosity corrected by means of the ratio {FIR}/{UV} has a small uncertainty. Finally, our model provides a calibration of {SFR} from radio luminosity; its value differs from estimates from other works, but we are able to reproduce the observed {FIR}/radio ratio. These results are relevant to estimates of the contribution of disk galaxies to the cosmic {SFR} at z {\textless}= 1.},

We then approximate this evolution with a carefully chosen equation of state and sound speed. With our scheme we find that we can obtain subpercent accuracy for the linear theory suppression of axion density fluctuations relative to that of cold dark matter without tracking even a single complete oscillation of the axion field. We use our technique to test other approximation schemes and to provide a fitting formula for the transfer function for the matter power spectrum in linear theory in axion models.

	abstract = {We use N-body simulations to study the effects that a divergent (i.e. ‘cuspy’) dark matter profile introduces on the tidal evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Our models assume cosmologically motivated initial conditions where dSphs are dark-matter-dominated systems on eccentric orbits about a host galaxy composed of a dark halo and a baryonic disc. We find that the resilience of dSphs to tidal stripping is extremely sensitive to the cuspiness of the inner halo profile; whereas dwarfs with a cored profile can be easily destroyed by the disc component, those with cusps always retain a bound remnant, even after losing more than 99.99 per cent of the original mass. For a given halo profile, the evolution of the structural parameters as driven by tides is controlled solely by the total amount of mass lost. This information is used to construct a semi-analytic code that follows the tidal evolution of individual satellites as they fall into a more massive host, which allows us to simulate the hierarchical build-up of spiral galaxies assuming different halo profiles and disc masses. We find that tidal encounters with discs tend to decrease the average mass of satellite galaxies at all galactocentric radii. Of all satellites, those accreted before re-ionization (z≳ 6), which may be singled out by anomalous metallicity patterns, provide the strongest constraints on the inner profile of dark haloes. These galaxies move on orbits that penetrate the disc repeatedly and survive to the present day only if haloes have an inner density cusp. We show that the size–mass relationship established from Milky Way (MW) dwarfs strongly supports the presence of cusps in the majority of these systems, as cored models systematically underestimate the masses of the known ultra-faint dSphs. Our models also indicate that a massive M31 disc may explain why many of its dSphs with suitable kinematic data fall below the size–mass relationship derived from MW dSphs. We also examine whether our modelling can constrain the mass threshold below which star formation is suppressed in dark matter haloes. We find that luminous satellites must be accreted with masses above 108–109 M⊙ in order to explain the size–mass relation observed in MW dwarfs.},

Universe is dominated by dark energy with an equation of state
w{\textless}-1/3, which is causing accelerated expansion. The build-up of
structure within such Universes is subject to significant ongoing study,
particularly through the spherical collapse model. This paper aims to
review and consolidate progress for cosmologies in which the dark energy
component remains homogeneous on the scales of the structures being
modelled. The equations presented are designed to allow for dark energy
with a general time-varying equation of state w(a). In addition to
reviewing previous work, a number of new results are introduced: a new
fitting formula for the linear growth factor in constant w cosmologies
is given. A new formalism for determining the critical density for
collapse is presented based on the initial curvature of the
perturbation. The commonly used approximation to the critical density
for collapse based on the linear growth factor is discussed for a
general dark energy equation of state. Virialisation within such
cosmologies is also considered, and the standard assumption that energy
is conserved between turn-around and virialisation is questioned and
limiting possiblities are presented.},

	abstract = {We present a Fourier analysis of the clustering of galaxies in the combined main galaxy and {LRG} {SDSS} {DR5} sample. The aim of our analysis is to consider how well we can measure the cosmological matter density using the signature of the horizon at matter-radiation equality embedded in the large-scale power spectrum. The new data constrain the power spectrum on scales 100-600 h-1 Mpc with significantly higher precision than previous analyses of just the {SDSS} main galaxies, due to our larger sample and the inclusion of the {LRGs.} This improvement means that we can now reveal a discrepancy between the shape of the measured power and linear {CDM} models on scales 0.01 h Mpc-1{\textbackslash}textless0.15 h Mpc-1, with linear model fits favoring a lower matter density ({OmegaM=0.22+/-0.04)} on scales 0.01 h Mpc-1{\textbackslash}textless0.06 h Mpc-1 and a higher matter density ({OmegaM=0.32+/-0.01)} when smaller scales are included, assuming a flat {LambdaCDM} model with h=0.73 and ns=0.96. This discrepancy could be explained by scale-dependent bias, and by analyzing subsamples of galaxies, we find that the ratio of small-scale to large-scale power increases with galaxy luminosity, so all of the {SDSS} galaxies cannot trace the same power spectrum shape over 0.01 h Mpc-1{\textbackslash}textless0.2 h Mpc-1. However, the data are insufficient to clearly show a luminosity-dependent change in the largest scale at which a significant increase in clustering is observed, although they do not rule out such an effect. Significant scale-dependent galaxy bias on large scales, which changes with the r-band luminosity of the galaxies, could potentially explain differences in our {OmegaM} estimates and differences previously observed between {2dFGRS} and {SDSS} power spectra and the resulting parameter constraints.},

From these, the loss of energy and angular momentum of a system due to the radiation of gravitational waves is found. Two techniques, radiation reaction and flux across a large sphere, are used in these calculations and are shown to be in agreement over a time average. In the nonrelativistic limit, the energy and angular momentum radiation and angular distributions are expressed in terms of time derivatives of the quadrupole tensor Qij. These results are then applied to a bound system of two point masses moving in elliptical orbits. The secular decays of the semimajor axis and eccentricity are found as functions of time, and are integrated to specify the decay by gravitational radiation of such systems as functions of their initial conditions.},

	abstract = {We present a new semi-analytic model for dynamical friction based on Chandrasekhar's formalism. The key novelty is the introduction of physically motivated, radially varying, maximum and minimum impact parameters. With these, our model gives an excellent match to full N-body simulations for isotropic background density distributions, both cuspy and shallow, without any fine tuning of the model parameters. In particular, we are able to reproduce the dramatic core-stalling effect that occurs in shallow/constant-density cores, for the first time. This gives us new physical insight into the core-stalling phenomenon. We show that core stalling occurs in the limit in which the product of the Coulomb logarithm and the local fraction of stars with velocity lower than the infalling body tends to zero. For cuspy backgrounds, this occurs when the infalling mass approaches the enclosed background mass. For cored backgrounds, it occurs at larger distances from the centre, due to a combination of a rapidly increasing minimum impact parameter and a lack of slow moving stars in the core. This demonstrates that the physics of core stalling is likely the same for both massive infalling objects and low-mass objects moving in shallow-density backgrounds. We implement our prescription for dynamical friction in the direct
summation code NBODY6 as an analytic correction for stars that remain within the Roche volume of the infalling object. This approach is computationally efficient, since only stars in the inspiralling system need to be evolved with direct summation. Our method can be applied to study a variety of astrophysical systems, including young star clusters orbiting near the Galactic Centre; globular clusters moving within the Galaxy; and dwarf galaxies orbiting within dark matter haloes.},

	abstract = {We measure the relation between galaxy luminosity and disk circular
velocity (the {Tully-Fisher} {[TF]} relation), in the g, r, i, and z bands,
for a broadly selected sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey, with the goal of providing well-defined observational
constraints for theoretical models of galaxy formation. The input sample
of 234 galaxies has a roughly flat distribution of absolute magnitudes
in the range -18.5 {\textgreater} Mr {\textgreater} -22, and our only
morphological selection is an isophotal axis ratio cut b/a {\textless} 0.6 to
allow accurate inclination corrections. Long-slit spectroscopy from the
Calar Alto and {MDM} observatories yields usable Hα rotation curves
for 162 galaxies (69\%), with a representative color and morphology
distribution. We define circular velocities V80 by evaluating
the rotation curve at the radius containing 80\% of the i-band light.
Observational errors, including estimated distance errors due to
peculiar velocities, are small compared to the intrinsic scatter of the
{TF} relation. The slope of the forward {TF} relation steepens from -5.5
± 0.2 mag (log10 km s-1)-1 in
the g band to -6.6 ± 0.2 mag (log10 km
s-1)-1 in the z band. The intrinsic scatter is
σ approx 0.4 mag in all bands, and residuals from either the
forward or inverse relations have an approximately Gaussian
distribution. We discuss how Malmquist-type biases may affect the
observed slope, intercept, and scatter. The scatter is not dominated by
rare outliers or by any particular class of galaxies, although it drops
slightly, to σ approx 0.36 mag, if we restrict the sample to
nearly bulgeless systems. Correlations of {TF} residuals with other galaxy
properties are weak: bluer galaxies are significantly brighter than
average in the g-band {TF} relation but only marginally brighter in the i
band; more concentrated (earlier type) galaxies are slightly fainter
than average, and the {TF} residual is virtually independent of half-light
radius, contrary to the trend expected for gravitationally dominant
disks. The observed residual correlations do not account for most of the
intrinsic scatter, implying that this scatter is instead driven largely
by variations in the ratio of dark to luminous matter within the disk
galaxy population.},

calibrate the stellar-to-halo mass conversion using realistic mock
catalogues based on the Millennium Simulation. Applying a
multi-frequency matched filter to the Planck data for each LBG, and
averaging the results in bins of stellar mass, we measure the mean SZ
signal down to M∗ {\textasciitilde} 2 × 1011
M⊙, with a clear indication of signal at even lower
stellar mass. We derive the scaling relation between SZ signal and halo
mass by assigning halo properties from our mock catalogues to the real
LBGs and simulating the Planck observation process. This relation shows
no evidence for deviation from a power law over a halo mass range
extending from rich clusters down to M500 {\textasciitilde} 2 ×
1013 M⊙, and there is a clear indication of
signal down to M500 {\textasciitilde} 4 × 1012
M⊙. Planck's SZdetections in such low-mass halos imply
that about a quarter of all baryons have now been seen in the form of
hot halo gas, and that this gas must be less concentrated than the dark
matter in such halos in order to remain consistent with X-ray
observations. At the high-mass end, the measured SZ signal is 20\% lower
than found from observations of X-ray clusters, a difference consistent
with the magnitude of Malmquist bias effects that were previously
estimated for the X-ray sample.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0605},
	abstract = {Black holes grow by accreting matter from their surroundings. However, angular momentum provides an efficient natural barrier to accretion and so only the lowest angular momentum material will be available to feed the black holes. The standard modelling of black hole growth in galaxy formation simulations (based on the {Bondi-Hoyle} method) takes no account of the angular momentum of accreting material, and so it is unclear how representative the estimated accretion rates in these simulations are likely to be. In this paper we introduce a new method for estimating the black hole accretion rate {(dM/dt)\_BH} that explicitly accounts for the angular momentum of accreting material. We model both the black hole and its accretion disc as a composite accretion disc particle. Gas particles are accreted by the accretion disc particle if and only if their orbits bring them within its accretion radius R\_acc. The gas mass is then added to the accretion disc and is available to feed the black hole on a viscous timescale t\_visc. The resulting {(dM/dt)\_BH} powers the accretion luminosity L\_acc {\textasciitilde} {(dM/dt)\_BH,} which in turn drives feedback from the black hole. Through a series of controlled numerical experiments we demonstrate that our new accretion disc particle method is far more physically self-consistent than the {Bondi-Hoyle} method. We also discuss the physical implications of the accretion disc particle method for systems with a high degree of rotational support, and we argue that the {M\_BH-sigma} relation in these systems should be offset from the relation for classical bulges and ellipticals, as appears to be observed.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT} Accurately predicting how the cosmic abundance of neutral
hydrogen evolves with redshift is a challenging problem facing modellers
of galaxy formation. We investigate the predictions of four currently
favoured semi-analytical galaxy formation models applied to the
Millennium simulation for the mass function of cold neutral gas (atomic
and molecular) in galaxies as a function of redshift, and we use these
predictions to construct number counts for the next generation of
all-sky neutral atomic hydrogen {(HI)} surveys. Despite the different
implementations of the physical ingredients of galaxy formation, we find
that the model predictions are broadly consistent with one another; the
key differences reflect how the models treat active galactic nuclei
feedback and how the time-scale for star formation evolves with
redshift. The models produce mass functions of cold gas in galaxies that
are generally in good agreement with {HI} surveys at . Interestingly, we
find that these mass functions do not evolve significantly with
redshift. Adopting a simple conversion factor for cold gas mass to {HI}
mass that we apply to all galaxies at all redshifts, we derive mass
functions of {HI} in galaxies from the predicted mass functions of cold
gas, which we use to predict the number counts of sources likely to be
detected by {HI} surveys on next generation radio telescopes such as the
Square Kilometre Array and its pathfinders. We find the number counts
peak at galaxies deg at for a year long {HI} hemispheric survey on a
1/10/100 per cent {SKA} with a 30 deg field of view, corresponding to an
integration time of 12 h. On a full {SKA} with a 200 deg field of view
(equivalent to an integration time of 80 h) the number counts peak at
galaxies deg at . We show also how adopting a conversion factor for cold
gas mass to {HI} mass that varies from galaxy to galaxy impacts on number
counts. In addition, we examine how the typical angular sizes of
galaxies vary with redshift. These decline strongly with increasing
redshift at and more gently at ; the median angular size varies between
5 and 10 arcsec at , 0.5 and 3 arcsec at and 0.2 and 1 arcsec at for
galaxies with {HI} masses in excess of , depending on the precise model.
Taken together, these results make clear that the forthcoming {HI} surveys
will provide important and powerful tests of theoretical galaxy
formation models.},

	abstract = {We study the concentration of dark matter halos and its evolution in N-body simulations of the standard {LCDM} cosmology. The results presented in this paper are based on 4 large N-body simulations with about 10 billion particles each: the {Millennium-I} and {II}, Bolshoi, and {MultiDark} simulations. The {MultiDark} (or {BigBolshoi)} simulation is introduced in this paper. This suite of simulations with high mass resolution over a large volume allows us to compute with unprecedented accuracy the concentration over a large range of scales (about six orders of magnitude in mass), which constitutes the state-of-the-art of our current knowledge on this basic property of dark matter halos in the {LCDM} cosmology. We find that there is consistency among the different simulation data sets. We confirm a novel feature for halo concentrations at high redshifts: a flattening and upturn with increasing mass. The concentration {c(M},z) as a function of mass and the redshift and for different cosmological parameters shows a remarkably complex pattern. However, when expressed in terms of the linear rms fluctuation of the density field {sigma(M},z), the halo concentration c(sigma) shows a nearly-universal simple U-shaped behaviour with a minimum at a well defined scale at sigma=0.71. Yet, some small dependences with redshift and cosmology still remain. At the high-mass end (sigma {\textless} 1) the median halo kinematic profiles show large signatures of infall and highly radial orbits. This {c-sigma(M},z) relation can be accurately parametrized and provides an analytical model for the dependence of concentration on halo mass. When applied to galaxy clusters, our estimates of concentrations are substantially larger -- by a factor up to 1.5 -- than previous results from smaller simulations, and are in much better agreement with results of observations.

	abstract = {We use an array of high-resolution N-body simulations to determine the mass function of dark matter haloes at redshifts 10-30. We develop a new method for compensating for the effects of finite simulation volume that allows us to find an approximation to the true `global' mass function. By simulating a wide range of volumes at different mass resolution, we calculate the abundance of haloes of mass
105-12h-1Msolar. This enables us to predict accurately the abundance of the haloes that host the sources that reionize the Universe. In particular, we focus on the small mass haloes ({\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}105.5-6h-1Msolar) likely to harbour Population III stars where gas cools by molecular hydrogen emission, early galaxies in which baryons cool by atomic hydrogen emission at a virial temperature of {\textasciitilde}104K
({\textasciitilde}107.5-8 h-1Msolar), and massive galaxies that may be observable at redshift {\textasciitilde}10. When we combine our data with simulations that include high-mass haloes at low redshift, we find that the best fit to the halo mass function depends not only on the linear overdensity, as is commonly assumed in analytic models, but also on the slope of the linear power spectrum at the scale of the halo mass. The Press-Schechter model gives a poor fit to the halo mass function in the simulations at all epochs; the Sheth-Tormen model gives a better match, but still overpredicts the abundance of rare objects at all times by up to 50 per cent. Finally, we consider the consequences of the recently released WMAP 3-yr cosmological parameters. These lead to much less structure at high redshift, reducing the number of z = 10
`mini-haloes' by more than a factor of two and the number of z = 30 galaxy hosts by nearly four orders of magnitude. Code to generate our best-fitting halo mass function may be downloaded from

In particular, a general analytical formula for the surface density, an important quantity that defines the lensing properties of a dark matter halo, is still lacking to date. To this aim, we used a Mellin integral transform formalism to derive a closed expression for the Einasto surface density and related properties in terms of the Fox H and Meijer G functions, which can be written as series expansions. This enables arbitrary-precision calculations of the surface density and the lensing properties of realistic dark matter halo models. Furthermore, we compared the Sérsic and Einasto surface mass densities and found differences between them, which implies that the lensing properties for both profiles differ.},

Reionization of the intergalactic medium ({IGM)} at z{\textgreater}5 may arise, in part, from the first luminous massive stars. To be an important source of radiative feedback from star formation, a substantial fraction ({\textasciitilde}1\%-10\%) of the ionizing photons must escape the gas layers of the galaxies. Using models of smoothly distributed gas confined by dark matter ({DM)} potentials, we estimate the fraction, esc{\textgreater} , of Lyman-continuum flux that escapes the halos of spherical galaxies as a function of their mass and virialization redshift. The gas density profile is found by solving the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium for the baryonic matter in the potential well of a {DM} halo with the density profile found by Navarro et al. We then perform a parametric study to understand the dependence of esc{\textgreater} on redshift, mass, baryonic fraction, star formation efficiency ({SFE)}, stellar density distribution, and {OB} association luminosity function. We give useful analytical formulas for esc({z,MDM){\textgreater}.} Using the Press-Schechter formalism, we find that stellar reionization at z{\textasciitilde}7 is probably dominated by small galactic subunits, with {MDM{\textless}{\textasciitilde}107} Msolar and {SFE{\textasciitilde}10} times that in the Milky Way.

	abstract = {Our heuristic understanding of the abundance of dark matter halos
centers around the concept of a density threshold, or "barrier," for
gravitational collapse. If one adopts the ansatz that regions of the
linearly evolved density field smoothed on mass scale M with an
overdensity that exceeds the barrier will undergo gravitational collapse
into halos of mass M, the corresponding abundance of such halos can be
estimated simply as a fraction of the mass density satisfying the
collapse criterion divided by the mass M. The key ingredient of this
ansatz is therefore the functional form of the collapse barrier as a
function of mass M or, equivalently, of the variance
{σ2(M).} Several such barriers based on the spherical,
Zel'dovich, and ellipsoidal collapse models have been extensively
discussed. Using large-scale cosmological simulations, we show that the
relation between the linear overdensity and the mass variance for
regions that collapse to form halos by the present epoch resembles
expectations from dynamical models of ellipsoidal collapse. However, we
also show that using such a collapse barrier with the excursion set
ansatz predicts a halo mass function inconsistent with that measured
directly in cosmological simulations. This inconsistency demonstrates a
failure of the excursion set ansatz as a physical model for halo
collapse. We discuss implications of our results for understanding the
collapse epoch for halos as a function of mass, and avenues for
improving consistency between analytical models for the collapse epoch
and the results of cosmological simulations.},

Our algorithm has been tested extensively on one family of mock GAMA lightcones, constructed from Λ cold dark matter N-body simulations populated with semi-analytic galaxies. Recovered group properties are robust to the effects of interlopers and are median unbiased in the most important respects. G3Cv1 contains 14 388 galaxy groups (with multiplicity ≥2), including 44 186 galaxies out of a possible 110 192 galaxies, implying ∼40 per cent of all galaxies are assigned to a group. The similarities of the mock group catalogues and G3Cv1 are multiple: global characteristics are in general well recovered. However, we do find a noticeable deficit in the number of high multiplicity groups in GAMA compared to the mocks. Additionally, despite exceptionally good local spatial completeness, G3Cv1 contains significantly fewer compact groups with five or more members, this effect becoming most evident for high multiplicity systems. These two differences are most likely due to limitations in the physics included of the current GAMA lightcone mock. Further studies using a variety of galaxy formation models are required to confirm their exact origin.

We find that this simple estimate works well in predicting the evolution of the radius of the remaining gas disc. Only if the ram pressure increases faster than the stripping time-scale, the disc radius remains larger than predicted. However, orbits with such short ram pressure peaks are unlikely to occur in other than compact clusters. Unlike the radius evolution, the mass-loss history for the galaxy is not accurately described by the analytical estimate. Generally, in the simulations the galaxy loses its gas more slowly than predicted.},

	abstract = {We present improved methods for segmenting CO emission from galaxies into individual molecular clouds, providing an update to the CPROPS algorithms presented by Rosolowsky \& Leroy. The new code enables both homogenization of the noise and spatial resolution among data, which allows for rigorous comparative analysis. The code also models the completeness of the data via false source injection and includes an updated segmentation approach to better deal with blended emission. These improved algorithms are implemented in a publicly available PYTHON package, PYCPROPS. We apply these methods to 10 of the nearest galaxies in the PHANGS-ALMA survey, cataloguing CO emission at a common 90 pc resolution and a matched noise level. We measure the properties of 4986 individual clouds identified in these targets. We investigate the scaling relations among cloud properties and the cloud mass distributions in each galaxy. The physical properties of clouds vary among galaxies, both as a function of galactocentric radius and as a function of dynamical environment. Overall, the clouds in our target galaxies are well-described by approximate energy equipartition, although clouds in stellar bars and galaxy centres show elevated line widths and virial parameters. The mass distribution of clouds in spiral arms has a typical mass scale that is 2.5× larger than interarm clouds and spiral arms clouds show slightly lower median virial parameters compared to interarm clouds (1.2 versus 1.4).},

	abstract = {We investigate the process of metal-free star formation in the first galaxies with a high-resolution cosmological simulation. We consider the cosmologically motivated scenario in which a strong molecule-destroying Lyman-Werner (LW) background inhibits effective cooling in low-mass haloes, delaying star formation until the collapse or more massive haloes. Only when molecular hydrogen (H2) can self-shield from LW radiation, which requires a halo capable of cooling by atomic line emission, will star formation be possible. To follow the formation of multiple gravitationally bound objects, at high gas densities we introduce sink particles which accrete gas directly from the computational grid. We find that in a 1 Mpc3 (comoving) box, runaway collapse first occurs in a 3 × 107 M⊙ dark matter halo at z ≈ 12 assuming a background intensity of J21 = 100. Due to a runaway increase in the H2 abundance and cooling rate, a self-shielding, supersonically turbulent core develops abruptly with ∼104 M⊙ in cold gas available for star formation. We analyse the formation of this self-shielding core, the character of turbulence and the prospects for star formation. Due to a lack of fragmentation on scales we resolve, we argue that LW-delayed metal-free star formation in atomic cooling haloes is very similar to star formation in primordial minihaloes, although in making this conclusion we ignore internal stellar feedback. Finally, we briefly discuss the detectability of metal-free stellar clusters with the James Webb Space Telescope.},

	abstract = {We examine the orbits of satellite galaxies identified in a suite of
N-body/gasdynamical simulations of the formation of L*
galaxies in a Lambda cold dark matter universe. The numerical resolution
of the simulations allows us to track in detail the orbits of the {\textasciitilde} 10
brightest satellites around each primary. Most satellites follow
conventional orbits; after turning around, they accrete into their host
halo and settle on orbits whose apocentric radii are steadily eroded by
dynamical friction. As a result, satellites associated with the primary
are typically found within its virial radius, rvir, and have
velocities consistent with a Gaussian distribution with mild radial
anisotropy. However, a number of outliers are also present. We find that
a surprising number (about one-third) of satellites identified at z = 0
are on unorthodox orbits, with apocentres that exceed their turnaround
radii. These include a number of objects with extreme velocities and
apocentric radii at times exceeding {\textasciitilde}3.5rvir (or, e.g. {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1
Mpc when scaled to the Milky Way). This population of satellites on
extreme orbits consists typically of the faint member of a satellite
pair whose kinship is severed by the tidal field of the primary during
first approach. Under the right circumstances, the heavier member of the
pair remains bound to the primary, whilst the lighter companion is
ejected on to a highly energetic orbit. Since the concurrent accretion
of multiple satellite systems is a defining feature of hierarchical
models of galaxy formation, a fairly robust prediction of this scenario
is that at least some of these extreme objects should be present in the
Local Group. We speculate that this three-body ejection mechanism may be
the origin of (i) some of the newly discovered high-speed satellites
around M31 (such as Andromeda {XIV);} (ii) some of the distant
fast-receding Local Group members, such as Leo I and (iii) the oddly
isolated dwarf spheroidals Cetus and Tucana in the outskirts of the
Local Group. Our results suggest that care must be exercised when using
the orbits of the most weakly bound satellites to place constraints on
the total mass of the Local Group.},

Our observations probe the star-forming disk of 19 nearby spiral galaxies with low inclination and located close to the star formation main sequence at z = 0. The mean LF slope, α, in our sample is =1.73 with a σ of 0.15. We find that α decreases with the galaxy's star formation rate surface density, ΣSFR, and argue that this is driven by an enhanced clustering of young stars at high gas surface densities. Looking at the H II regions within single galaxies, we find that no significant variations occur between the LF of the inner and outer part of the star-forming disk, whereas the LF in the spiral arm areas is shallower than in the inter-arm areas for six out of the 13 galaxies with clearly visible spiral arms. We attribute these variations to the spiral arms increasing the molecular clouds' arm-inter-arm mass contrast and find suggestive evidence that they are more evident for galaxies with stronger spiral arms. Furthermore, we find systematic variations in α between samples of H II regions with a high and low ionization parameter, q, and argue that they are driven by the aging of H II regions.

	abstract = {We examine the nonlinear structure of gravitationally collapsed objects that form in our simulations of wavelike cold dark matter, described by the Schrödinger-Poisson (SP) equation with a particle mass ∼1 0-22 eV . A distinct gravitationally self-bound solitonic core is found at the center of every halo, with a profile quite different from cores modeled in the warm or self-interacting dark matter scenarios. Furthermore, we show that each solitonic core is surrounded by an extended halo composed of large fluctuating dark matter granules which modulate the halo density on a scale comparable to the diameter of the solitonic core. The scaling symmetry of the SP equation and the uncertainty principle tightly relate the core mass to the halo specific energy, which, in the context of cosmological structure formation, leads to a simple scaling between core mass (Mc) and halo mass (Mh), Mc∝a-1 /2Mh1 /3, where a is the cosmic scale factor. We verify this scaling relation by (i) examining the internal structure of a statistical sample of virialized halos that form in our 3D cosmological simulations and by (ii) merging multiple solitons to create individual virialized objects. Sufficient simulation resolution is achieved by adaptive mesh refinement and graphic processing units acceleration. From this scaling relation, present dwarf satellite galaxies are predicted to have kiloparsec-sized cores and a minimum mass of ∼1 08M⊙, capable of solving the small-scale controversies in the cold dark matter model. Moreover, galaxies of 2 ×1 012M⊙ at z =8 should have massive solitonic cores of ∼2 ×1 09M⊙ within ∼60 pc . Such cores can provide a favorable local environment for funneling the gas that leads to the prompt formation of early stellar spheroids and quasars.},

We do this in two different ways: with the halo model approach and with the help of an ensemble of high-resolution N-body simulations. Combining these quasi-independent approaches leads to a physical understanding of the important processes which shape the formation of structures. We take a detailed look at the halo mass function, the concentrations and the linear halo bias of {WDM}. In all cases we find interesting deviations with respect to cold dark matter ({CDM}). In particular, the concentration-mass relation displays a turnover for group scale dark matter haloes, for the case of {WDM} particles with masses of the order of {mWDM}˜ 0.25 {keV}. This may be interpreted as a hint for top-down structure formation on small scales. We implement our results into the halo model and find much better agreement with simulations.

	abstract = {All commonly considered dark matter scenarios are based on hypothetical particles with small but non-zero thermal velocities and tiny
interaction cross-sections. A generic consequence of these attributes is the suppression of small-scale matter perturbations either due to free-streaming or due to interactions with the primordial plasma. The suppression scale can vary over many orders of magnitude depending on particle candidate and production mechanism in the early Universe. While non-linear structure formation has been explored in great detail well above the suppression scale, the range around suppressed perturbations is still poorly understood. In this paper, we study structure formation in the regime of suppressed perturbations using both analytical
techniques and numerical simulations. We develop simple and
theoretically motivated recipes for the halo mass function, the expected number of satellites, and the halo concentrations, which are designed to work for power spectra with suppression at arbitrary scale and of arbitrary shape. As case studies, we explore warm and mixed dark matter scenarios where effects are most distinctive. Additionally, we examine the standard dark matter scenario based on weakly interacting massive particles (WIMP) and compare it to pure cold dark matter with zero primordial temperature. We find that our analytically motivated recipes are in good agreement with simulations for all investigated dark matter scenarios, and we therefore conclude that they can be used for generic cases with arbitrarily suppressed small-scale perturbations.},

The star formation picture provided by a total of 10 497 individual far-infrared detections is supplemented by the stacking analysis of a mass complete sample of 62 361 star-forming galaxies from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) H band-selected catalogs of the CANDELS survey and from two deep ground-based K{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}s{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} band-selected catalogs in the GOODS-North and the COSMOS-wide field to obtain one of the most accurate and unbiased understanding to date of the stellar mass growth over the cosmic history. We show, for the first time, that stacking also provides a powerful tool to determine the dispersion of a physical correlation and describe our method called "scatter stacking", which may be easily generalized to other experiments. The combination of direct UV and far-infrared UV-reprocessed light provides a complete census on the star formation rates (SFRs), allowing us to demonstrate that galaxies at z = 4 to 0 of all stellar masses (M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}∗{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) follow a universal scaling law, the so-called main sequence of star-forming galaxies. We find a universal close-to-linear slope of the log {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}(SFR)-log {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}(M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}∗{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) relation, with evidence for a flattening of the main sequence at high masses (log {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}10{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}(M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}∗{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) \&gt; 10.5) that becomesless prominent with increasing redshift and almost vanishes by z ≃ 2. This flattening may be due to the parallel stellar growth of quiescent bulges in star-forming galaxies, which mostly happens over the same redshift range. Within the main sequence, we measure a nonvarying SFR dispersion of 0.3 dex: at a fixed redshift and stellar mass, about 68\% of star-forming galaxies form stars at a universal rate within a factor 2. The specific SFR (sSFR = SFR/M{\textless}SUB{\textgreater}∗{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater}) of star-forming galaxies is found to continuously increase from z = 0 to 4. Finally we discuss the implications of our findings on the cosmic SFR history and on the origin of present-day stars: more than two-thirds of present-day stars must have formed in a regime dominated by the "main sequence" mode. As a consequence we conclude that, although omnipresent in the distant Universe, galaxy mergers had little impact in shaping the global star formation history over the last 12.5 billion years. {\textless}P /{\textgreater}Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.Appendices are available in electronic form at {\textless}A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201425017/olm"{\textgreater}http://www.aanda.org{\textless}/A{\textgreater}},

the early universe. The difference from previous calculations is that we
use multilevel atoms and evolve the population of each level with
redshift by including all bound-bound and bound-free transitions. In
this framework we follow several hundred atomic energy levels for H, He
I, and He {II} combined. The main improvements of this method over
previous recombination calculations are (1) allowing excited atomic
level populations to depart from an equilibrium distribution, (2)
replacing the total recombination coefficient with recombination to and
photoionization from each level calculated directly at each redshift
step, and (3) correct treatment of the He I atom, including the triplet
and singlet states. We find that
{xe(≡ne/nH)} is approximately 10\%
smaller at redshifts {\textless}{\textasciitilde}800 than in previous calculations, as a result
of the nonequilibrium of the excited states of H that is caused by the
strong but cool radiation field at those redshifts. In addition, we find
that He I recombination is delayed compared with previous calculations
and occurs only just before H recombination. These changes in turn can
affect the predicted power spectrum of microwave anisotropies at the few
percent level. Other improvements, such as including molecular and ionic
species of H, including complete heating and cooling terms for the
evolution of the matter temperature, including collisional rates, and
including feedback of the secondary spectral distortions on the
radiation field, produce negligible change to the ionization fraction.
The lower xe at low z found in this work affects the
abundances of H molecular and ionic species by 10\%-25\%. However, this
difference is probably not larger than other uncertainties in the
reaction rates.},

A brief history of the transforms is related and a simple motivation for the transforms is given. Examples are given of the application of these transformations to divergent and slowly convergent sequences. In particular the examples include numerical series, the power series of rational and meromorphic functions, and a wide variety of sequences drawn from continued fractions, integral equations, geometry, fluid mechanics, and number theory. Theorems are proven which show the effectiveness of the transformations both in accelerating the convergence of (some) slowly convergent sequences and in inducing convergence in (some) divergent sequences. The essential unity of these two motives is stressed. Theorems are proven which show that these transforms often duplicate the results of well-known, but specialized techniques. These special algorithms include Newton's iterative process, Gauss's numerical integration, an identity of Euler, the Padé Table, and Thiele's reciprocal differences. Difficulties which sometimes arise in the use of these transforms such as irregularity, non-uniform convergence to the wrong answer, and the ambiguity of multivalued functions are investigated. The concepts of antilimit and of the spectra of sequences are introduced and discussed. The contrast between discrete and continuous spectra and the consequent contrasting response of the corresponding sequences to the e1 transformation is indicated. The characteristic behaviour of a semiconvergent (asymptotic) sequence is elucidated by an analysis of its spectrum into convergent components of large amplitude and divergent components of small amplitude.},

Sky Survey {(SDSS)} to study the size distribution of galaxies and its
dependence on their luminosity, stellar mass and morphological type. The
large {SDSS} data base provides statistics of unprecedented accuracy. For
each type of galaxy, the size distribution at given luminosity (or
stellar mass) is well described by a log-normal function, characterized
by its median and dispersion {σlnR.} For late-type
galaxies, there is a characteristic luminosity at Mr,0{\textasciitilde}-20.5
(assuming h= 0.7) corresponding to a stellar mass M0{\textasciitilde}
1010.6 Msolar. Galaxies more massive than
M0 have and {σlnR{\textasciitilde}} 0.3, while less massive
galaxies have and {σlnR{\textasciitilde}} 0.5. For early-type galaxies,
the relation is significantly steeper, , but the {σlnR-M}
relation is similar to that of bright late-type galaxies. Faint red
galaxies have sizes quite independent of their luminosities. We use
simple theoretical models to interpret these results. The observed
relation for late-type galaxies can be explained if the fraction of
baryons that form stars is as predicted by the standard feedback model.
Fitting the observed {σlnR-M} relation requires in
addition that the bulge/disc mass ratio be larger in haloes of lower
angular momentum and that the bulge material transfers part of its
angular momentum to the disc. This can be achieved if bulge formation
occurs so as to maintain a marginally stable disc. For early-type
galaxies, the observed {σlnR-M} relation is inconsistent
with formation through single major mergers of present-day discs. It is
consistent with formation through repeated mergers, if the progenitors
have properties similar to those of faint ellipticals or Lyman break
galaxies and merge from relatively strongly bound orbits.},

It is a simple extension of the excursion set model that is commonly used to estimate the mass function of collapsed dark matter haloes. In addition to describing the evolution of the Eulerian space distribution of the haloes, the model allows one to describe the evolution of the dark matter itself. It can also be used to describe density profiles, on scales larger than the virial radius of these haloes, and to quantify the way in which matter flows in and out of Eulerian cells. When the initial Lagrangian space distribution is white noise Gaussian, the model suggests that the Inverse Gaussian distribution should provide a reasonably good approximation to the evolved Eulerian density field, in agreement with numerical simulations. Application of this model to clustering from more general Gaussian initial conditions is discussed at the end.},

	abstract = {The {Press-Schechter,} excursion set approach allows one to make predictions about the shape and evolution of the mass function of bound objects. The approach combines the assumption that objects collapse spherically with the assumption that the initial density fluctuations were Gaussian and small. The predicted mass function is reasonably accurate, although it has fewer high-mass and more low-mass objects than are seen in simulations of hierarchical clustering. We show that the discrepancy between theory and simulation can be reduced substantially if bound structures are assumed to form from an ellipsoidal, rather than a spherical, collapse. In the original, standard, spherical model, a region collapses if the initial density within it exceeds a threshold value, deltasc. This value is independent of the initial size of the region, and since the mass of the collapsed object is related to its initial size, this means that deltasc is independent of final mass. In the ellipsoidal model, the collapse of a region depends on the surrounding shear field, as well as on its initial overdensity. In Gaussian random fields, the distribution of these quantities depends on the size of the region considered. Since the mass of a region is related to its initial size, there is a relation between the density threshold value required for collapse and the mass of the final object. We provide a fitting function to this deltaec(m) relation which simplifies the inclusion of ellipsoidal dynamics in the excursion set approach. We discuss the relation between the excursion set predictions and the halo distribution in high-resolution N-body simulations, and use our new formulation of the approach to show that our simple parametrization of the ellipsoidal collapse model represents an improvement on the spherical model on an object-by-object basis. Finally, we show that the associated statistical predictions, the mass function and the large-scale halo-to-mass bias relation, are also more accurate than the standard predictions.},

The predictions of this approach depend on how the non-linear processes of collapse and virialization are modelled. We present simple analytic approximations that allow us to compare the excursion set predictions associated with spherical and ellipsoidal collapse. In particular, we present formulae for the universal unconditional mass function of bound objects and the conditional mass function which describes the mass function of the progenitors of haloes in a given mass range today. We show that the ellipsoidal collapse based moving barrier model provides a better description of what we measure in the numerical simulations than the spherical collapse based constant barrier model, although the agreement between model and simulations is better at large lookback times. Our results for the conditional mass function can be used to compute accurate approximations to the local-density mass function, which quantifies the tendency for massive haloes to populate denser regions than less massive haloes. This happens because low-density regions can be thought of as being collapsed haloes viewed at large lookback times, whereas high-density regions are collapsed haloes viewed at small lookback times. Although we have applied our analytic formulae only to two simple barrier shapes, we show that they are, in fact, accurate for a wide variety of moving barriers. We suggest how they can be used to study the case in which the initial dark matter distribution is not completely cold.},

The result provides a good description of the evolution of ξ(r) in simulations. We then use this decomposition to provide simple and accurate models of how the single-particle velocity dispersion evolves with time, and how the first and second moments of the pairwise velocity distribution depend on scale. The key idea is to use the simple physics of linear theory on large scales, the simple physics of the virial theorem on small scales and our model for the correlation function to tell us how to weight the two types of contributions (linear and non-linear) to the pairwise velocity statistics.

Comparisons with simulations suggest that our model is accurate. We also show that the evolution of the peculiar velocities depends on the local, rather than the global, density. Since clusters populate denser regions on average, using cluster velocities with the linear theory scaling may lead to an overestimate of the global value of Ω0. Conversely, using linear theory with the global value of Ω0 to scale cluster velocities from the initial to the present time results in an underestimate of their true velocities. In general, however, the directions of motions of haloes are rather well described by linear theory. Our results help to simplify models of redshift-space distortions considerably.},

	abstract = {We propose an "extended Schmidt law" with explicit dependence of the star formation efficiency {(SFE} = {SFR/M} gas) on the stellar mass surface density (Σstar). This relation has a power-law index of 0.48 ± 0.04 and a 1σ observed scatter on the {SFE} of 0.4 dex, which holds over five orders of magnitude in the stellar density for individual global galaxies, including various types and especially the low-surface-brightness {(LSB)} galaxies that deviate significantly from the {Kennicutt-Schmidt} {(KS)} law. When applying it to regions of a sample of 12 spiral galaxies at sub-kiloparsec resolution, the extended Schmidt law not only holds for {LSB} regions but also shows significantly smaller scatters both within and across galaxies compared with the {KS} law. We argue that this new relation points to the role of existing stars in regulating the {SFE}, thus better encoding the star formation physics. Comparison with physical models of star formation recipes shows that the extended Schmidt law can be reproduced by some models including gas free fall in a stellar-gravitational potential and pressure-supported star formation. By implementing this new law into the analytic model of gas accretion in {ΛCDM}, we show that it can reproduce the observed main sequence of star-forming galaxies (a relation between the {SFR} and stellar mass) from z = 0 up to z = 2.},

Possible observational detections have even been made for galaxy clusters. Theoretically, Adhikari et al. have estimated the location of the splashback radius by computing the secondary infall trajectory of a dark matter shell through a growing dark matter halo with an NFW profile. However, since they imposed a shape of the halo profile rather than computing it consistently from the trajectories of the dark matter shells, they could not provide the full shape of the dark matter profile around the splashback radius. We improve on this by extending the self-similar spherical collapse model of Fillmore \& Goldreich to a ΛCDM universe. This allows us to compute the dark matter halo
profile and the trajectories simultaneously from the mass accretion history. Our results on the splashback location agree qualitatively with Adhikari et al. but with small quantitative differences at large mass accretion rates. We present new fitting formulae for the splashback radius Rsp in various forms, including the ratios of
Rsp/R200c and Rsp/R200m. Numerical simulations have made the puzzling discovery that the
splashback radius scales well with R200m but not with R200c. We trace the origin of this to be the correlated increase of Ωm and the average halo mass accretion rate with an increasing redshift.},

particular care. A chemical evolution code follows the star formation
rate, the gas fraction, and the metallicity, basic ingredients for the
stellar population synthesis. The latter is performed with a grid of
integrated spectra of simple stellar populations {(SSP)} of different ages
and metallicities, in which the effects of dusty envelopes around
asymptotic giant branch {(AGB)} stars are included. The residual fraction
of gas in the galaxy is divided into two phases: the star-forming
molecular clouds and the diffuse medium. The relative amount is a model
parameter. The molecular gas is subdivided into clouds of given mass and
radius: it is supposed that each {SSP} is born within the cloud and
progressively escapes it. The emitted spectrum of the star-forming
molecular clouds is computed with a radiative transfer code. The diffuse
dust emission (cirrus) is derived by describing the galaxy as an axially
symmetric system, in which the local dust emissivity is consistently
calculated as a function of the local field intensity due to the stellar
component. Effects of very small grains, subject to temperature
fluctuations, as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons {(PAHs)} are

	abstract = {We present the results of a large library of cosmological N-body simulations, using power-law initial spectra. The non-linear evolution of the matter power spectra is compared with the predictions of existing analytic scaling formulae based on the work of Hamilton et al. The scaling approach has assumed that highly non-linear structures obey `stable clustering' and are frozen in proper coordinates. Our results show that, when transformed under the self-similarity scaling, the scale-free spectra define a non-linear locus that is clearly shallower than would be required under stable clustering. Furthermore, the small-scale non-linear power increases as both the power spectrum index n and the density parameter Ω decrease, and this evolution is not well accounted for by the previous scaling formulae. This breakdown of stable clustering can be understood as resulting from the modification of dark matter haloes by continuing mergers. These effects are naturally included in the analytic `halo model' for non-linear structure; we use this approach to fit both our scale-free results and also our previous cold dark matter data.

	abstract = {We develop the halo model of large-scale structure to include triaxial dark matter haloes and their intrinsic alignments. As a direct
application we derive general expressions for the two-point correlation function and the power spectrum. We then focus on the power spectrum and numerically solve the general expressions for two different models of the triaxial profiles. The first is a toy model that allows us to isolate the dependence of clustering on halo shape alone and the second is the more realistic profile model of Jing \& Suto. In both cases, we find that the effect of triaxiality is manifest as a suppression of power at the level of {\textasciitilde}5 per cent on scales k{\textasciitilde} 1-10hMpc-1, which in real space corresponds to the virial radii of clusters. When considered by mass, we find that for the first model the effects are again apparent as a suppression of power and that they are more
significant for the high-mass haloes. For the Jing \& Suto model, we find a suppression of power on large scales followed by a sharp
amplification on small scales at the level of {\textasciitilde}10-15 per cent.
Interestingly, when averaged over the entire mass function this
amplification effect is suppressed. We also find for the one-halo term on scales k {\textless} 10hMpc-1 that the power is dominated by ellipsoidal haloes with semi-minor to semi-major axis ratios a/c {\textless} 0.7.

One of the important features of our formalism is that it allows for the self-consistent inclusion of the intrinsic alignments of haloes. The alignments are specified through the correlation function of halo seeds. We develop a useful toy model for this and then make estimates of the alignment contribution to the power spectrum. Further, through
consideration of the (artificial) case where all haloes are perfectly aligned, we calculate the maximum possible contribution to the
clustering. We find the hard limit of {\textless}10 per cent. Subject to
further scrutiny, the proposed toy model may serve as a means for linking the actual observed intrinsic alignments of galaxies to physical quantities of interest.},

	abstract = {We investigate the error properties of certain galaxy luminosity function ({GLF)} estimators. Using a cluster expansion of the density field, we show how, for both volume and flux limited samples, the {GLF} estimates are covariant. The covariance matrix can be decomposed into three pieces: a diagonal term arising from Poisson noise; a sample variance term arising from large-scale structure in the survey volume; an occupancy covariance term arising due to galaxies of different luminosities inhabiting the same cluster. To evaluate the theory one needs: the mass function and bias of clusters, and the conditional luminosity function ({CLF).} We use a semi-analytic model ({SAM)} galaxy catalogue from the Millennium run N-body simulation and the {CLF} of Yang et al. (2003) to explore these effects. The {GLF} estimates from the {SAM} and the {CLF} qualitatively reproduce results from the {2dFGRS.} We also measure the luminosity dependence of clustering in the {SAM} and find reasonable agreement with {2dFGRS} results for bright galaxies. However, for fainter galaxies, L0.5. Our theory is in good agreement with these measurements. These strong correlations can be attributed to sample variance. For a flux-limited survey of similar volume, the estimates are only slightly less correlated. We explore the importance of these effects for {GLF} model parameter estimation. We show that neglecting to take into account the bin-to-bin covariances can lead to significant systematic errors in best-fit parameters.},

	abstract = {This paper presents new deep and wide narrow-band surveys undertaken 
with United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT), Subaru and the Very
Large Telescope (VLT), a unique combined effort to select large, robust
samples of Hα star-forming galaxies at z = 0.40, 0.84, 1.47 and
2.23 (corresponding to look-back times of 4.2, 7.0, 9.2 and 10.6 Gyr) in
a uniform manner over ˜2 deg2 in the Cosmological
Evolution Survey and Ultra Deep Survey fields. The deep multi-epoch
Hα surveys reach a matched 3σ flux limit of ≈3
M⊙ yr-1 out to z = 2.2 for the first time,
while the wide area and the coverage over two independent fields allow
us to greatly overcome cosmic variance and assemble by far the largest
samples of Hα emitters. Catalogues are presented for a total of
1742, 637, 515 and 807 Hα emitters, robustly selected at z = 0.40,
0.84, 1.47 and 2.23, respectively, and used to determine the Hα
luminosity function and its evolution. The faint-end slope of the
Hα luminosity function is found to be α = -1.60 ±
0.08 over z = 0-2.23, showing no significant evolution. The
characteristic luminosity of star-forming galaxies,
L*Hα, evolves significantly as log
L*Hα(z) = 0.45z + log L*z = 0. This is the
first time Hα has been used to trace star formation activity with
a single homogeneous survey at z = 0.4-2.23. Overall, the evolution seen
with Hα is in good agreement with the evolution seen using
inhomogeneous compilations of other tracers of star formation, such as
far-infrared and ultraviolet, jointly pointing towards the bulk of the
evolution in the last 11 Gyr being driven by a statistically similar
star-forming population across cosmic time, but with a strong luminosity
increase from z ˜ 0 to ˜2.2. Our uniform analysis allows us
to derive the Hα star formation history (SFRH) of the Universe,
showing a clear rise up to z ˜ 2.2, for which the simple
parametrization log10ρSFR = -2.1(1 +
z)-1 is valid over 80 per cent of the age of the Universe.
The results reveal that both the shape and normalization of the Hα
SFRH are consistent with the measurements of the stellar mass density
growth, confirming that our Hα SFRH is tracing the bulk of the
formation of stars in the Universe for z {\textless} 2.23. The star formation
activity over the last ˜11 Gyr is responsible for producing
˜95 per cent of the total stellar mass density observed locally,
with half of that being assembled in 2 Gyr between z = 1.2 and 2.2, and
the other half in 8 Gyr (since z {\textless} 1.2). If the star formation rate
density continues to decline with time in the same way as seen in the
past ˜11 Gyr, then the stellar mass density of the Universe will
reach a maximum which is only 5 per cent higher than the present-day
value.},

	abstract = {We present a new semi-analytic model that self-consistently traces the growth of supermassive black holes {(BH)} and their host galaxies within the context of the Lambda cold dark matter {(LambdaCDM)} cosmological framework. In our model, the energy emitted by accreting black holes regulates the growth of the black holes themselves, drives galactic scale winds that can remove cold gas from galaxies, and produces powerful jets that heat the hot gas atmospheres surrounding groups and clusters. We present a comprehensive comparison of our model predictions with observational measurements of key physical properties of low-redshift galaxies, such as cold gas fractions, stellar metallicities and ages, and specific star formation rates. We find that our new models successfully reproduce the exponential cut-off in the stellar mass function and the stellar and cold gas mass densities at z {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0, and predict that star formation should be largely, but not entirely, quenched in massive galaxies at the present day. We also find that our model of self-regulated {BH} growth naturally reproduces the observed relation between {BH} mass and bulge mass. We explore the global formation history of galaxies and black holes in our models, presenting predictions for the cosmic histories of star formation, stellar mass assembly, cold gas and metals. We find that models assuming the `concordance' {LambdaCDM} cosmology overproduce star formation and stellar mass at high redshift (z {\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 2). A model with less small-scale power predicts less star formation at high redshift, and excellent agreement with the observed stellar mass assembly history, but may have difficulty accounting for the cold gas in quasar absorption systems at high redshift (z {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 3-4).},

The availability of flux measurements in the Spitzer Infrared Array Camera 3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8 μm channels allows us to compute absolute magnitudes in the rest-frame J and H bands up to z = 3.5 minimizing the dependence on the stellar evolution models. We compute the LF in the four redshift bins: 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.0; 2.0 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5; 2.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.0 and 3.0 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5. Combining our results with those already available at lower redshifts, we find that (1) the faint-end slope is consistent with being constant up to z = 3.5, with α = -1.05 ± 0.03 for the rest-frame J band and α = -1.15 ± 0.02 for the rest-frame H band; (2) the normalization φ* decreases by a factor of 4-6 between z = 0 and z ≃ 1.75 and by a factor of 2-3 between z ≃ 1.75 and z = 3.25; (3) the characteristic magnitude M* shows a brightening from z = 0 to z ≃ 2 followed by a slow dimming to z = 3.25. We finally compute the luminosity density (LD) in both rest-frame J and H bands. The analysis of our results together with those available in the literature shows that the LD is approximately constant up to z ≈ 1, and it then decreases by a factor of 6 up to z = 3.5.},

The mean convergence measured in the source plane is found to be systematically negative, rather than zero as often assumed, and is correlated with the convergence variance. We provide simple analytical formulae for the {PDFs}, which reproduce simulated {PDFs} reasonably well for a wide range of redshifts and smoothing sizes.

	abstract = {We have developed a simple yet surprisingly accurate analytic scheme for tracking the dynamical evolution of substructure within dark matter halos. The scheme incorporates the effects of dynamical friction, tidal mass loss, and tidal heating via physically motivated approximations. Using our scheme, we can predict the orbital evolution and mass-loss history of individual subhalos in detail. We are also able to determine the impact and importance of the different physical processes on the dynamical evolution of the subhalos. To test and calibrate this model, we compare it with a set of recent high-resolution numerical simulations of mergers between galaxies and small companions. We find that we can reproduce the orbits and mass-loss rates seen in all of these simulations with considerable accuracy, using a single set of values for the three free parameters in our model. Computationally, our scheme is more than 1000 times faster than the simplest of the high-resolution numerical simulations. This means that we can carry out detailed and statistically meaningful investigations into the characteristics of the subhalo population in different cosmologies, the stripping and disruption of the subhalos, and the interactions of the subhalos with other dynamical structures such as a thin disk. This last point is of particular interest given the ubiquity of minor mergers in hierarchical models. In this regard, our method's simplicity and speed makes it particularly attractive for incorporation into semianalytic models of galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {The minimum mass that a virialized gas cloud must have in order to be able to cool in a Hubble time is computed, using a detailed treatment of the chemistry of molecular hydrogen. With a simple model for halo profiles, we reduce the problem to that of numerically integrating a system of chemical equations. The results agree well with numerically expensive three-dimensional simulations, and our approach has the advantage of being able to explore large regions of parameter space rapidly. The minimum baryonic mass Mb is found to be strongly redshift dependent, dropping from 106 Mo at z {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde 15 to 5 x 10ˆ3 Mo at z {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde 100 as molecular cooling becomes effective. For z {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextgreater 100, Mb rises again, as cosmic microwave background photons inhibit H2 formation through the H- channel. Finally, for z {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextgreater 200, the Hˆ+2 channel for H2 formation becomes effective, driving Mb down toward Mb {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde 10ˆ3 Mo. With a standard cold dark matter power spectrum with sigma 8 = 0.7, this implies that a fraction 10-3 of all baryons may have formed luminous objects by z = 30, which could be sufficient to reheat the universe.},

	abstract = {Differential Evolution ({DE)} is a simple genetic algorithm for numerical optimization in real parameter spaces. In a statistical context one would not just want the optimum but also its uncertainty. The uncertainty distribution can be obtained by a Bayesian analysis (after specifying prior and likelihood) using Markov Chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC)} simulation. This paper integrates the essential ideas of {DE} and {MCMC}, resulting in Differential Evolution Markov Chain ({DE-MC).} {DE-MC} is a population {MCMC} algorithm, in which multiple chains are run in parallel. {DE-MC} solves an important problem in {MCMC}, namely that of choosing an appropriate scale and orientation for the jumping distribution. In {DE-MC} the jumps are simply a fixed multiple of the differences of two random parameter vectors that are currently in the population. The selection process of {DE-MC} works via the usual Metropolis ratio which defines the probability with which a proposal is accepted. In tests with known uncertainty distributions, the efficiency of {DE-MC} with respect to random walk Metropolis with optimal multivariate Normal jumps ranged from 68\% for small population sizes to 100\% for large population sizes and even to 500\% for the 97.5\% point of a variable from a 50-dimensional Student distribution. Two Bayesian examples illustrate the potential of {DE-MC} in practice. {DE-MC} is shown to facilitate multidimensional updates in a multi-chain {“Metropolis-within-Gibbs”} sampling approach. The advantage of {DE-MC} over conventional {MCMC} are simplicity, speed of calculation and convergence, even for nearly collinear parameters and multimodal densities.},

	abstract = {We present the results of numerical studies of supernova remnant
evolution and its effects on galactic and globular cluster evolution. We
show that parameters such as the density and the metallicity of the
environment significantly influence the evolution of the remnant and
thus change its effects on the global environment (e.g., globular
clusters, galaxies) as a source of thermal and kinetic energy. We
conducted our studies using a one-dimensional hydrodynamics code, in
which we implemented a metallicity-dependent cooling function. Global
time-dependent quantities such as the total kinetic and thermal energies
and the radial extent are calculated for a grid of parameter sets. The
quantities calculated are the total energy, the kinetic energy, the
thermal energy, the radial extent, and the mass. We distinguished
between the hot, rarefied bubble and the cold, dense shell, since these
two phases are distinct in their roles in a gas-stellar system. We also
present power-law fits to those quantities as a function of
environmental parameters after the extensive cooling has ceased. The
power-law fits enable simple incorporation of improved supernova energy
input and matter redistribution (including the effect of the local
conditions) in galactic/globular cluster models. Our results for the
energetics of supernova remnants in the late stages of their expansion
give total energies ranging from {\textasciitilde}9 x 1049 to {\textasciitilde}3 x 1050 ergs, with a
typical case being {\textasciitilde}1050 ergs, depending on the surrounding environment.
About 8.5 x 1049 ergs of this energy can be found in the form of kinetic
energy. Supernovae play an important role in the evolution of the
interstellar medium and galaxies as a whole, providing mechanisms for
kinetic energy input and for phase transitions of the interstellar
medium. However, we have found that the total energy input per supernova
is about 1 order of magnitude smaller than the initial explosion energy.},

observationally motivated power spectrum shape and increasing
normalization σ8, we find parameters of the galaxy halo occupation distribution (HOD) that reproduce
wp(rp) measurements as a function of luminosity from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). From these HOD models we calculate the r-band conditional luminosity function
Φ(L{\textbar}Mh), and from this the mean M/L ratio as a function of halo mass Mh. We also use Φ(L{\textbar}Mh) to
populate halos of N-body simulations with galaxies and thereby compute M/L in a range of large-scale environments, including cluster infall regions. For all cosmological models, the M/L ratio in high-mass halos or high-density regions is approximately independent of halo mass or smoothing scale. However, the ``plateau'' value of M/L depends on σ8 in addition to the obvious proportionality with the matter density parameter Ωm, and it represents the
universal value
=Ωmρcrit/ρlum

approximately unbiased, i.e., with

halos follow the trend
(M/L)cl=577(Ωm/0.3)(σ8/0.9)1.7 h Msolar/Lsolar. Combined with the mean M/L ratio for CNOC galaxy clusters, this relation implies
(σ8/0.9)(Ωm/0.3)0.6=0.75+/-0.06. M/L estimates for SDSS clusters and the virial regions of clusters in the CAIRNS survey imply a similar value of
σ8Ω0.6m, while the CAIRNS

σ8{\textasciitilde}0.9 favored by recent joint analyses of cosmic

satisfactory. In appendices we present an improved formula for halo bias factors calibrated on our 3603 N-body simulations and an improved analytic technique for calculating the galaxy correlation function from a given cosmological model and HOD.},

We use these data to constrain the halo occupation distribution (HOD) of 2dFGRS galaxies, then calculate the PVD by populating the halos of a large-volume, high-resolution N-body simulation. We examine the luminosity and scale dependence of the predicted PVD. At small and large scales, r {\textless} 1 and r ≳ 3 h-1 Mpc, we find that the PVD decreases with increasing galaxy luminosity. This result is mostly driven by the fraction of satellite galaxies fsat, which is well constrained by the correlation function. We find fsat 25\% for galaxies fainter than L*, while for brighter galaxies the satellite fraction rapidly declines, creating the decrease in the PVD with luminosity. Recent measurements of the PVD in Fourier space using the "dispersion model" have reported a strong decline in the PVD with increasing luminosity at k = 1 Mpc-1 h. We test this method with our HOD models, finding a luminosity dependence in k-space that is stronger than that in configuration space at that scale. The luminosity dependence of the HOD results in Fourier space are consistent with those measured at k = 1 Mpc-1 h; thus, the recent measurements of the PVD are fully explainable in the context of halo occupation models. The normalization of the PVD is lower than that predicted by our fiducial model, and reproducing it requires a lower value of Ωm ( 0.2 instead of 0.3), a lower value of σ8 ( 0.7 instead of 0.9), or a significant bias between the velocity dispersion of galaxies and dark matter in massive halos.},

enclosing specific overdensities. We argue that these spherical
overdensity masses are more directly linked to cluster observables than
masses measured using the friends-of-friends algorithm {(FOF),} and are
therefore preferable for accurate forecasts of halo abundances. Our

function, in the sense that the same functional form and parameters can
be used for different cosmologies and redshifts when expressed in
appropriate variables. In addition to our fitting formulae, our main
finding is that the mass function cannot be represented by a universal

After identification of all cluster progenitors in the simulations, we select those haloes that accrete directly on to the main cluster progenitor.

The average circularity of the orbits is epsilon{\textasciitilde}=0.5, while either radial or almost circular orbits are equally avoided. More massive satellites move along slightly more eccentric orbits, with lower specific angular momentum and a smaller pericentre. We find that the infall of satellites on to the main cluster progenitor has a very anisotropic distribution. This anisotropy is to a large extent responsible for the shape and orientation of the final cluster and of its velocity ellipsoid. At the end of the simulations, the major axis of the cluster is aligned both with that of its velocity ellipsoid and with the major axis of the ellipsoid defined by the satellite infall pattern, to {\textasciitilde}30 deg on average. We also find that, in lower mass clusters, a higher fraction of the final virial mass is provided by small, dense satellites. These sink to the centre of the parent cluster and so enhance its central density.

	volume = {546},
	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJ...546...63T},
	abstract = {The thermodynamics of the diffuse, X-ray-emitting gas in clusters of
galaxies is determined by gravitational processes associated with
infalling gas, shock heating and adiabatic compression, and
nongravitational processes such as heating by supernovae, stellar winds,
activity in central galactic nuclei, and radiative cooling. The effect
of gravitational processes on the thermodynamics of the intracluster
medium {(ICM)} can be expressed in terms of the {ICM} entropy. The entropy
is a convenient variable as long as cooling is negligible, since it
remains constant during the phase of adiabatic compression during
accretion into the potential well, and it shows a single steplike
increase during shock heating. Observations indicate that
nongravitational processes also play a key role in determining the
distribution of entropy in the {ICM.} In particular, an entropy excess
with respect to that produced by purely gravitational processes has been
recently detected in the centers of low-temperature systems. This type
of entropy excess is believed to be responsible for many other
properties of local X-ray clusters, including the {L-T} relation and the
flat density cores in clusters and groups. In this paper we assume that
the entropy excess is present in the intergalactic medium {(IGM)} baryons
before the gas is accreted by the dark matter halos and reaches high
densities. We use a generalized spherical model to compute the X-ray
properties of groups and clusters for a range of initial entropy levels
in the {IGM} and for a range of mass scales, cosmic epochs, and background
cosmologies. In particular, we follow the formation of adiabatic cores
during the first stages of the gravitational collapse and the subsequent
evolution of the central entropy due to radiative energy loss. The model
predicts the statistical properties of the cluster population at a given
epoch and also allows study of the evolution of single X-ray halos as a
function of their age. We find that the statistical properties of the
X-ray clusters strongly depend on the value of the initial background
entropy. Assuming a constant, uniform value for the background entropy,
the present-day X-ray data are well fitted for the following range of
values of the adiabatic constant:
{K*≡kBT/μmpρ2/3=(0.4+/-0.1)×1034} ergs cm2
g-5/3 for clusters with average temperatures {kT{\textgreater}2} {keV} and
K*=(0.2+/-0.1)×1034 ergs cm2
g-5/3 for groups and clusters with average temperatures
{kBT{\textless}2} {keV.} These values correspond to different excess
energy per particle of
{kBT{\textgreater}=0.1(K*/0.4×1034)} {keV.} The
dependence of K* on the mass scale can be well reproduced by
an epoch-dependent external entropy: the relation
K*=0.8(1+z)-1×1034 ergs
cm2 g-5/3 fits the data over the whole temperature
range. The model can be extended to include internal heating, but in
this case the energy budget required to fit the X-ray properties would
be much higher. Observations of both local and distant clusters can be
used to trace the distribution and the evolution of the entropy in the
cosmic baryons and to constrain the typical epoch and the source of the
heating processes. The X-ray satellites Chandra and {XMM} can add to our
knowledge of the history of the cosmic baryons, already derived from the
high-redshift, low-density gas observed in the {QSO} absorption-line
clouds, by imaging the hot, higher density plasma observed in groups and
clusters of galaxies.},

High-resolution N-body simulations are run to quantify the abundance of dark matter halos as a function of mass M, accretion rate {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}, and redshift z. A new fit for the halo mass function dn/dM is ≈20\% more accurate at the high-mass end. A novel approach is used to fit the halo accretion rate function
\{dn\}/d{\textbackslash}dot\{M\} in terms of the halo mass function. Abundance matching against the observed galaxy luminosity function is used to estimate the luminosity-mass relation and the luminosity-accretion-rate
relation. The inferred star formation efficiency is not monotonic with M nor {\textbackslash}dot\{M\}, but reaches a maximum value at a characteristic mass ˜ 2× \{10\}11 \{M\}⊙ and a characteristic
accretion rate ˜ 6× \{10\}2 \{M\}⊙

	abstract = {Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation often rely on prescriptions for star formation and feedback that depend on halo properties such as halo mass, central overdensity, and virial temperature. In this paper, we address the convergence of individual halo properties, based on their number of particles N, focusing, in particular, on the mass of halos near the resolution limit of a simulation. While it has been established that the halo mass function is sampled on average down to N {\textasciitilde} 20-30 particles, we show that individual halo properties exhibit significant scatter, and some systematic biases, as one approaches the resolution limit. We carry out a series of cosmological simulations using the Gadget2 and Enzo codes with Np = 643 to
Np = 10243 total particles, keeping the same large-scale structure in the simulation box. We consider boxes of small (l box = 8 Mpc h -1), medium (l box = 64 Mpc h -1), and large (l box = 512 Mpc h -1) size to probe different halo masses and formation redshifts. We cross-identify dark matter halos in boxes at different resolutions and measure the scatter in their properties. The uncertainty in the mass of single halos depends on the number of particles (scaling approximately as N -1/3), but the rarer the density peak, the more robust its identification. The virial radius of halos is very stable and can be measured without bias for halos with N {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 30. In contrast, the average density within a sphere containing 25\% of the total halo mass is severely underestimated (by more than a factor 2) and the halo spin is moderately overestimated for N {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 100. If sub-grid physics is implemented upon a cosmological simulation, we recommend that rare halos ({\textasciitilde}3σ peaks) be resolved with N {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 100 particles and
common halos ({\textasciitilde}1σ peaks) with N {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde} 400 particles to avoid
excessive numerical noise and possible systematic biases in the results.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005MNRAS.359.1029V},
	abstract = {We present a simple, semi-analytical model to compute the mass functions of dark matter subhaloes. The masses of subhaloes at their time of accretion are obtained from a standard merger tree. During the subsequent evolution, the subhaloes experience mass loss due to the combined effect of dynamical friction, tidal stripping, and tidal heating. Rather than integrating these effects along individual subhalo orbits, we consider the average mass-loss rate, where the average is taken over all possible orbital configurations. Under the Ansatz that the average distribution of orbits is independent of parent halo mass, this allows us to write the average mass-loss rate as a simple function that depends only on redshift and on the instantaneous mass ratio of subhalo and parent halo. After calibrating this model by matching the subhalo mass function {(SHMF)} of cluster-sized dark matter haloes obtained from high-resolution, numerical simulations, we investigate the predicted mass and redshift dependence of the {SHMF.} We find that, contrary to previous claims, the subhalo mass function is not universal. Instead, both the slope and the normalization depend on the ratio of the parent halo mass, M, and the characteristic non-linear mass M*. This simply reflects a halo formation time dependence; more massive parent haloes form later, thus allowing less time for mass loss to operate. We predict that galaxy-sized haloes, with a present-day mass of M{\textasciitilde}= {1012h-1Msolar,} have an average mass fraction of dark matter subhaloes that is a factor of 3 lower than for massive clusters with M{\textasciitilde}= {1015h-1Msolar.} We also analyse the halo-to-halo scatter in {SHMFs,} and show that the subhalo mass fraction of individual haloes depends most strongly on their accretion history in the last {{\textasciitilde}1Gyr.} Finally we provide a simple fitting function for the average {SHMF} of a parent halo of any mass at any redshift and for any cosmology, and briefly discuss several implications of our findings.},

Using a different ansatz for the out-of-plane kick, we show that we can fit almost all existing data to better than 5 \%. This is good enough for any astrophysical calculation, and shows that the previous apparent conflict was only because the two data sets explored different aspects of the kick parameter space.},

	abstract = {The centres of galaxies host nuclear stellar clusters, supermassive black holes, or both. The origin of this dichotomy is still a mystery. Nuclear stellar clusters are the densest stellar system in the Universe, so they are ideal places for runaway collisions to occur. Previous studies have proposed the possible existence of a critical mass scale in such clusters, for which the occurrence of collisions becomes very frequent and leads to the formation of a very massive object. While it is difficult to directly probe this scenario with simulations, we here aim for a proof of concept using toy models where the occurrence of such a transition is shown based on simplified compact systems, where the typical evolution time-scales will be faster compared to the real Universe. Indeed our simulations confirm that such a transition takes place and that up to 50 per cent of the cluster mass can go into the formation of a central massive object for clusters that are above the critical mass scale. Our results thus support the proposed new scenario on the basis of idealized simulations. A preliminary analysis of observed nuclear star clusters shows similar trends related to the critical mass as in our simulations. We further discuss the caveats for the application of the proposed scenario in real nuclear star clusters.},

We probe three different redshifts, and several halo concentrations, mass ratios, orbital circularities and orbital energies of the satellite.

We argue that these results have not been highlighted previously either because the evolution of halo concentration of satellite galaxies has been neglected (in previous isolated merger simulations) or because long merger times and mergers with high initial orbital circularities are under-represented (for prescriptions based on cosmological simulations). Motivated by the evolution of halo concentration at fixed mass, an explicit dependence on redshift added as
tmergermod(z) = (1 + z)0.44 tmerger to the prescription based on isolated mergers gives a significant improvement in the predicted merger times up to ˜20 tdyn in the redshift range 0 ≤ z ≤ 2. When this
modified prescription is used to compute galaxy stellar mass functions, we find that it leads up to a 25 per cent increase in the number of low-mass galaxies surviving at z = 0, and a 10 per cent increase for more massive galaxies.

       abstract = {We propose a new explanation for the origin of angular momentum in galaxies and their dark halos, in which the halos obtain their spin through the cumulative acquisition of angular momentum from satellite accretion. In our model, the buildup of angular momentum is a random walk process associated with the mass assembly history of the halo's major progenitor. We assume no correlation between the angular momenta of accreted objects. The main role of tidal torques in this approach is to produce the random tangential velocities of merging satellites. Using the extended Press-Schechter approximation, we calculate the growth of mass, angular momentum, and spin parameter lambda for many halos. Our random walk model reproduces the key features of the angular momentum of halos found in LambdaCDM N-body simulations: a lognormal distribution in lambda with an average of \textasciitilde0.045 and dispersion sigmalambda=0.56, independent of mass and redshift. The evolution of the spin parameter in individual halos in this model is quite different from the steady increase with time of angular momentum in the tidal torque picture. We find both in N-body simulations and in our random walk model that the value of lambda changes significantly with time for a halo's major progenitor. It typically has a sharp increase due to major mergers and a steady decline during periods of gradual accretion of small satellites. The model predicts that, on average, the lambda of \textasciitilde1012 Msolar halos that had major mergers after redshift z=3 should be substantially larger than the lambda of those that did not. Perhaps surprisingly, this suggests that halos that host later forming elliptical galaxies should rotate faster than halos of spiral galaxies.},

	abstract = {We assess models for the assembly of supermassive black holes {(SMBHs)} at the center of galaxies that trace their hierarchical buildup far up in the dark halo ``merger tree.'' Motivated by the recent discovery of luminous quasars around redshift z{\textasciitilde}6-suggesting a very early assembly epoch-and by numerical simulations of the fragmentation of primordial molecular clouds in cold dark matter {(CDM)} cosmogonies, we assume that the first ``seed'' black holes {(BHs)} had intermediate masses and formed in (mini)halos collapsing at z{\textasciitilde}20 from high-σ density fluctuations. As these pregalactic holes become incorporated through a series of mergers into larger and larger halos, they sink to the center because of dynamical friction, accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become supermassive, form a binary system, and eventually coalesce. The merger history of dark matter halos and associated {BHs} is followed by cosmological Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times until the present in a {ΛCDM} cosmology. A simple model, where quasar activity is driven by major mergers and {SMBHs} accrete at the Eddington rate a mass that scales with the fifth power of the circular velocity of the host halo, is shown to reproduce the observed luminosity function of optically selected quasars in the redshift range 1{\textless}5. A scheme for describing the hardening of a {BH} binary in a stellar background with core formation due to mass ejection is applied, where the stellar cusp proportional to r-2 is promptly regenerated after every major merger event, replenishing the mass displaced by the binary. Triple {BH} interactions will inevitably take place at early times if the formation route for the assembly of {SMBHs} goes back to the very first generation of stars, and we follow them in our merger tree. The assumptions underlying our scenario lead to the prediction of a population of massive {BHs} wandering in galaxy halos and the intergalactic medium at the present epoch and contributing {\textless}{\textasciitilde}10\% to the total {BH} mass density, {ρSMBH=4×105} Msolar Mpc-3 (h=0.7). The fraction of binary {SMBHs} in galaxy nuclei is on the order of 10\% today, and it increases with redshift so that almost all massive nuclear {BHs} at early epochs are in binary systems. The fraction of binary quasars (both members brighter than {0.1L*)} instead is less than 0.3\% at all epochs. The nuclear {SMBH} occupation fraction is unity (0.6) at the present epoch if the first seed {BHs} were as numerous as the 3.5 σ (4 σ) density peaks at z=20.},

Over the same redshift range, the sSFR of the entire cluster population declines by a factor of 11, from to . This strong overall sSFR evolution is driven by the growth of the quiescent population over time; the fraction of quiescent cluster galaxies increases from to over z ∼ 1.3 to 0.2. The majority of the growth occurs at , where the quiescent fraction increases by 0.41. While the sSFR of the majority of star-forming cluster galaxies is at the level of the field, a small subset of cluster SFGs have low field-relative star formation activity, suggestive of long-timescale quenching. The large increase in the fraction of quiescent galaxies above , coupled with the field-level sSFRs of cluster SFGs, suggests that higher-redshift cluster galaxies are likely being quenched quickly.

	abstract = {We present a new systematic way of setting up galactic gas disks based on the assumption of detailed hydrodynamic equilibrium. To do this, we need to specify the density distribution and the velocity field which supports the disk. We first show that the required circular velocity has no dependence on the height above or below the midplane so long as the gas pressure is a function of density only. The assumption of disks being very thin enables us to decouple the vertical structure from the radial direction. Based on that, the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium together with the reduced Poisson equation leads to two sets of second-order non-linear differential equation, which are easily integrated to set-up a stable disk. We call one approach `density method' and the other one `potential method'. Gas disks in detailed balance are especially suitable for investigating the onset of the gravitational instability. We revisit the question of global, axisymmetric instability using fully three-dimensional disk simulations. The impact of disk thickness on the disk instability and the formation of spontaneously induced spirals is studied systematically with or without the presence of the stellar potential. In our models, the numerical results show that the threshold value for disk instability is shifted from unity to 0.69 for self-gravitating thick disks and to 0.75 for combined stellar and gas thick disks. The simulations also show that self-induced spirals occur in the correct regions and with the right numbers as predicted by the analytic theory.},

	abstract = {We study the relation between the density profiles of dark matter halos

a high-resolution N-body simulation of the {ΛCDM} cosmology. For
each halo at z=0, we identify its merger history tree and determine
concentration parameters cvir for all progenitors, thus
providing a structural merger tree for each halo. We fit the mass
accretion histories by a universal function with one parameter, the
formation epoch ac, defined when the log mass accretion rate
{dlogM/dloga} falls below a critical value S. We find that late-forming
galaxies tend to be less concentrated, such that cvir
``observed'' at any epoch ao is strongly correlated with
ac via
cvir=c1ao/ac. Scatter about
this relation is mostly due to measurement errors in cvir and
ac, implying that the actual spread in cvir for
halos of a given mass can be mostly attributed to scatter in
ac. We demonstrate that this relation can also be used to
predict the mass and redshift dependence of cvir and the
scatter about the median {cvir(M,z)} using accretion histories
derived from the extended {Press-Schechter} {(EPS)} formalism, after
adjusting for a constant offset between the formation times as predicted
by {EPS} and as measured in the simulations; this new ingredient can thus
be easily incorporated into semianalytic models of galaxy formation. The
correlation found between halo concentration and mass accretion rate
suggests a physical interpretation: for high mass infall rates, the
central density is related to the background density; when the mass
infall rate slows, the central density stays approximately constant, and
the halo concentration just grows as Rvir. Because of the
direct connection between halo concentration and velocity rotation
curves and because of probable connections between halo mass assembly
history and star formation history, the tight correlation between these
properties provides an essential new ingredient for galaxy formation
modeling.},

	abstract = {We examine the prospect of using the observed abundance of weak gravitational lenses to constrain the equation-of-state parameter w=p/ρ of dark energy. Dark energy modifies the distance-redshift relation, the amplitude of the matter power spectrum, and the rate of structure growth. As a result, it affects the efficiency with which dark-matter concentrations produce detectable weak-lensing signals. Here we solve the spherical-collapse model with dark energy, clarifying some ambiguities found in the literature. We also provide fitting formulae for the non-linear overdensity at virialization and the linear-theory overdensity at collapse. We then compute the variation in the predicted weak-lens abundance with w. We find that the predicted redshift distribution and number count of weak lenses are highly degenerate in w and the present matter density Ω0. If we fix Ω0 the number count of weak lenses for w=-2/3 is a factor of {\textasciitilde}2 smaller than for the Λ cold dark matter ({CDM)} model w=-1. However, if we allow Ω0 to vary with w such that the amplitude of the matter power spectrum as measured by the Cosmic Background Explorer ({COBE)} matches that obtained from the X-ray cluster abundance, the decrease in the predicted lens abundance is less than 25 per cent for -1 {\textless}=w{\textless} -0.4. We show that a more promising method for constraining dark energy - one that is largely unaffected by the Ω0-w degeneracy as well as uncertainties in observational noise - is to compare the relative abundance of virialized X-ray lensing clusters with the abundance of non-virialized, X-ray underluminous, lensing haloes. For aperture sizes of {\textasciitilde}15 arcmin, the predicted ratio of the non-virialized to virialized lenses is greater than 40 per cent and varies by {\textasciitilde}20 per cent between w=-1 and -0.6. Overall, we find that, if all other weak-lensing parameters are fixed, a survey must cover at least {\textasciitilde}40 deg2 in order for the weak-lens number count to differentiate a {ΛCDM} cosmology from a dark-energy model with w=-0.9 at the 3σ level. If, on the other hand, we take into account uncertainties in the lensing parameters, then the non-virialized lens fraction provides the most robust constraint on w, requiring {\textasciitilde}50 deg2 of sky coverage in order to differentiate a {ΛCDM} model from a w=-0.6 model to 3σ.},

	abstract = {Using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey Data Release 2, we investigate the correlation between
various galaxy properties and halo mass. We split the population of
galaxies in early-types, late-types and intermediate-types, based on
their colour and specific star formation rate. At fixed luminosity, the
late- (early-)type fraction of galaxies increases (decreases) with
decreasing halo mass. Most importantly, this mass dependence is smooth
and persists over the entire mass range probed, without any break or
feature at any mass-scale. We argue that the previous claim of a
characteristic feature on galaxy group scales is an artefact of the
environment estimators used. At fixed halo mass, the luminosity
dependence of the type fractions is surprisingly weak, especially over
the range 0.25 {{\textless}{\textasciitilde}L/L*{\textless}{\textasciitilde}} 2.5: galaxy type depends more strongly on
halo mass than on luminosity. In agreement with previous studies, the
late- (early-)type fraction increases (decreases) with increasing
halocentric radius. However, we find that this radial dependence is
present in haloes of all masses probed (down to
{1012h-1Msolar),} while previous studies
did not find any radial dependence in haloes with M{\textless}{\textasciitilde}
{1013.5h-1Msolar.} We argue that this
discrepancy owes to the fact that we have excluded central galaxies from
our analysis. We also find that the properties of satellite galaxies are
strongly correlated with those of their central galaxy. In particular,
the early-type fraction of satellites is significantly higher in a halo
with an early-type central galaxy than in a halo of the same mass but
with a late-type central galaxy. This phenomenon, which we call
`galactic conformity', is present in haloes of all masses and for
satellites of all luminosities. Finally, the fraction of
intermediate-type galaxies is always {\textasciitilde}20 per cent, independent of
luminosity, independent of halo mass, independent of halocentric radius,
and independent of whether the galaxy is a central galaxy or a satellite
galaxy. We discuss the implications of all these findings for galaxy
formation and evolution.},

While the dense halo environment rapidly strips subhaloes of their dark mass, the compact luminous material can remain intact for some time, making the correspondence of galaxies with severely stripped subhaloes unclear. Many galaxy evolution models assume that satellite galaxies eventually merge with their central galaxy, but this ignores the possibility of satellite tidal disruption. We use a high-resolution N-body simulation of cosmological volume to explore satellite galaxy merging/disruption criteria based on dark matter subhalo dynamics. We explore the impact that satellite merging/disruption has on the halo occupation distribution and radial profile of the remnants. Using abundance matching to assign stellar mass/luminosity to subhaloes, we compare with observed galaxy clustering, satellite fractions, cluster satellite luminosity functions, finding that subhaloes reproduce well these observables. Our results imply that satellite subhaloes corresponding to {{\textgreater}0.2L*} galaxies must be well resolved down to 1-3 per cent of their mass at infall to robustly trace the galaxy population. We also explore a simple analytic model based on dynamical friction for satellite galaxy infall, finding good agreement with our subhalo catalogue and observations.},

The model accounts for the large amount of nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80\% or more of the virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies.

Extinction and scattering properties for two types of interstellar dust, similar to those found in the average diffuse medium of the Milky Way ({MW}) and the Bar of the Small Magellanic Cloud ({SMC}), are considered. The wavelength coverage extends from 1000 to 30000 Å, with particular emphasis on the rest-frame {UV}. This makes these models especially applicable to starburst galaxies and Lyman-break galaxy samples. The examination of the models concentrates on the study of {UV}/visual/near-{IR} reddening effects, the wavelength dependence of attenuation, and on the changes that arise from the transition from homogeneous to clumpy dust distributions in different star/dust
geometries. Embedded dust, especially when clumpy, leads to saturation at fairly low reddening values with correspondingly gray attenuation functions. This makes the assessment of the attenuation of the far-{UV} flux from starburst galaxies difficult, if only {UV}/visual/near-{IR} data are available. Existing data for {UV}-selected starburst galaxies indicate a range of {UV} attenuation factors of 0-150. Our models reproduce the ``Calzetti Attenuation Law,'' provided one adopts {SMC}-type dust and a clumpy shell-type dust distribution surrounding the starbursts. The average far-{UV} attenuation factor for the Calzetti sample is found to be 7.4. The only relatively reliable measure for the {UV} attenuation factor for single galaxies was found in the ratio of the integrated far-{IR} flux to the far-{UV} flux, measured near 1600 Å, requiring the
measurement of the entire spectral energy distribution of galaxies.},

	abstract = {The major theoretical limitation for extracting cosmological parameters
from the cosmic microwave background {(CMB)} sky lies in the precision
with which we can calculate the cosmological recombination process.
Uncertainty in the details of hydrogen and helium recombination could
effectively increase the errors or bias the values of the cosmological
parameters derived from the Planck satellite, for example. Here, we
modify the cosmological recombination code {RECFAST} by introducing one
more parameter to reproduce the recent numerical results for the
speed-up of the helium recombination. Together with the existing
hydrogen fudge factor, we vary these two parameters to account for the
remaining dominant uncertainties in cosmological recombination. By using
the {COSMOMC} code with Planck forecast data, we find that we need to
determine the parameters to better than 10 per cent for {HeI} and 1 per
cent for H, in order to obtain negligible effects on the cosmological
parameters. For helium recombination, if the existing studies have
calculated the ionization fraction to the 0.1 per cent level by properly
including the relevant physical processes, then we already have
numerical calculations which are accurate enough for Planck. For
hydrogen, setting the fudge factor to speed up low-redshift
recombination by 14 per cent appears to be sufficient for Planck.
However, more work still needs to be done to carry out comprehensive
numerical calculations of all the relevant effects for hydrogen, as well
as to check for effects which couple hydrogen and helium recombination
through the radiation field.},

These unprecedented measurements provide valuable information regarding the ISM properties, stellar populations, galaxy morphologies, and kinematics in these high-redshift galaxies and, in principle, offer powerful tests of state of the art galaxy formation models, as implemented in hydrodynamical simulations. To facilitate direct comparisons between simulations and observations, we develop a fast post-processing pipeline to predict line emission from the H II regions around simulated star particles, accounting for spatial variations in the surrounding gas density, metallicity, and incident radiation spectrum. Our ISM line emission model currently captures H α, H β, and all of the [O III] and [O II] lines targeted by ALMA and JWST at z {\textgreater} 6. We illustrate the power of this approach by applying our line emission model to the publicly available Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE) high-z simulation suite and perform a detailed comparison with current observations. We show that the FIRE mass-metallicity relation is in 1σ agreement with ALMA/JWST measurements after accounting for the inhomogeneities in the ISM properties. We also quantitatively validate the description of the one-zone model, which is widely used for interpreting [O III] and H β line luminosity measurements. This model is publicly available and can be implemented on top of a broad range of galaxy formation simulations for comparison with JWST and ALMA measurements.},

	abstract = {We compare two techniques for following the cooling of gas and its condensation into galaxies within high-resolution simulations of cosmologically representative regions. Both techniques treat the dark matter using N-body methods. One follows the gas using smoothed particle hydrodynamics {(SPH)} while the other uses simplified recipes from semi-analytic {(SA)} models. We compare the masses and locations predicted for dense knots of cold gas (the `galaxies') when the two techniques are applied to evolution from the same initial conditions and when the additional complications of star formation and feedback are ignored. We find that above the effective resolution limit of the two techniques, they give very similar results both for global quantities such as the total amount of cooled gas and for the properties of individual `galaxies'. The {SA} technique has systematic uncertainties arising from the simplified cooling model adopted, while details of the {SPH} implementation can produce substantial systematic variations in the galaxy masses it predicts. Nevertheless, for the best current {SPH} methods and the standard assumptions of the {SA} model, systematic differences between the two techniques are remarkably small. The {SA} technique gives adequate predictions for the condensation of gas into `galaxies' at less than one per cent of the computational cost of obtaining similar results at comparable resolution using {SPH.}},

	volume = {707},
	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...707..354Z},
	abstract = {A large amount of observations have constrained cosmological parameters
and the initial density fluctuation spectrum to a very high accuracy.
However, cosmological parameters change with time and the power index of
the power spectrum dramatically varies with mass scale in the so-called
concordance {ΛCDM} cosmology. Thus, any successful model for its
structural evolution should work well simultaneously for various
cosmological models and different power spectra. We use a large set of
high-resolution N-body simulations of a variety of structure formation
models (scale-free, standard {CDM,} open {CDM,} and {ΛCDM)} to study
the mass accretion histories, the mass and redshift dependence of
concentrations, and the concentration evolution histories of dark matter
halos. We find that there is significant disagreement between the
much-used empirical models in the literature and our simulations. Based
on our simulation results, we find that the mass accretion rate of a
halo is tightly correlated with a simple function of its mass, the
redshift, parameters of the cosmology, and of the initial density
fluctuation spectrum, which correctly disentangles the effects of all
these factors and halo environments. We also find that the concentration
of a halo is strongly correlated with the universe age when its
progenitor on the mass accretion history first reaches 4\% of its current
mass. According to these correlations, we develop new empirical models
for both the mass accretion histories and the concentration evolution
histories of dark matter halos, and the latter can also be used to
predict the mass and redshift dependence of halo concentrations. These
models are accurate and universal: the same set of model parameters
works well for different cosmological models and for halos of different
masses at different redshifts, and in the {ΛCDM} case the model
predictions match the simulation results very well even though halo mass
is traced to about 0.0005 times the final mass, when cosmological
parameters and the power index of the initial density fluctuation
spectrum have changed dramatically. Our model predictions also match the
{PINOCCHIO} mass accretion histories very well, which are much independent
of our numerical simulations and our definitions of halo merger trees.
These models are also simple and easy to implement, making them very
useful in modeling the growth and structure of dark matter halos. We
provide appendices describing the step-by-step implementation of our
models. A calculator which allows one to interactively generate data for
any given cosmological model is provided on the Web, together with a
user-friendly code to make the relevant calculations and some tables
listing the expected concentration as a function of halo mass and
redshift in several popular cosmological models. We explain why
{ΛCDM} and open {CDM} halos on nearly all mass scales show two
distinct phases in their mass growth histories. We discuss implications
of the universal relations we find in connection to the formation of
dark matter halos in the cosmic density field.},

The survey yielded 66 significant extragalactic signals, of which approximately 50\% are cataloged galaxies. No
free-floating H I clouds without stars are found. {VLA} follow-up
observations of all signals have been used to obtain better measurements of the positions and fluxes and to allow an alternate determination of the achieved survey sensitivity. The resulting {HIMF} has a shallow faint-end slope ( alpha {\textasciitilde} 1.2) and is consistent with earlier estimates computed for the population of optically selected gas-rich galaxies. This implies that there is not a large population of gas-rich
low-luminosity or low-surface brightness galaxies that has gone
unnoticed by optical surveys. The influence of large-scale structure on the determination of the {HIMF} from the Arecibo H I Strip Survey was tested by numerical experiments and was not found to affect the
resulting {HIMF} significantly. The cosmological mass density of H I at the present time, determined from the survey, Omega H I(z = 0) = (2.0 +/- 0.5) x 10-4 h-1, is in good agreement with earlier estimates. We determine lower limits for the average column densities of the galaxies detected in the survey and find that none of the galaxies have {\textless} 1019.7 cm-2, although there are no observational
selection criteria against finding lower density systems. Eight percent of the signals detected in the original survey originated in groups of galaxies whose signals chanced to coincide in frequency.},

	abstract = {We present a semianalytic model for cold dark matter halo substructure that can be used as a framework for studying the physics of galaxy formation and as an ingredient in halo models of galaxy clustering. The model has the following main ingredients: (1) extended Press-Schechter mass accretion histories, (2) host halo density profiles computed according to the trends observed in cosmological simulations, (3) distributions of initial orbital parameters of accreting subhalos measured in a high-resolution simulation of three Milky Way-size halos, and (4) integration of the orbital evolution of subhalos including the effects of dynamical friction and tidal mass loss. We perform a comprehensive comparison of the model calculations to the results of a suite of high-resolution cosmological simulations. The comparisons show that subhalo statistics such as the velocity and mass functions, the radial distributions, and the halo occupation distributions agree well over 3 orders of magnitude in host halo mass and at various redshifts. We find that both in the simulations and in our model the radial distributions of subhalos are significantly shallower than that of the dark matter density. The abundance of subhalos in a host is set by competition between tidal disruption and new accretion. Halos of high mass and halos at high redshift tend to host more subhalos because the subhalos have, on average, been accreted more recently. Similarly, at a fixed mass and epoch, halos that formed more recently host a larger number of subhalos. Observed ``fossil groups'' may represent an extreme tail of this correlation. We find a related correlation between host halo concentration and satellite abundance at fixed host mass, Nsat{\textasciitilde}c-avir, where a changes with redshift and host-to-subhalo mass ratio. Lastly, we use our substructure model to populate host halos in one of the high-resolution cosmological simulations, replacing the actual subhalos resolved in this simulation and using the host mass as the only input for the model calculation. We show that the resulting correlation function of such a hybrid halo ensemble is indistinguishable from that measured directly in the simulation. This supports one of the key tenets of the standard halo model, i.e., the assumption that the halo occupation distribution is statistically independent of the host halo environment.},

The DM halo models are constructed with various asymptotic power-law indices ranging from steep cusps to corelike profiles and the structural properties of the galaxy models are motivated by the ΛCDM paradigm of structure formation. The adopted force resolution allows robust density profile estimates in the inner ~1% of the virial radii of the simulated systems. We demonstrate that the central slopes and overall shapes of the remnant density profiles are virtually identical to those of the initial systems, suggesting that the remnants retain a remarkable memory of the density structure of their progenitors, despite the relaxation that accompanies merger activity. We also find that halo concentrations remain approximately constant through hierarchical merging involving identical systems and show that remnants contain significant fractions of their bound mass well beyond their formal virial radii. These conclusions hold for a wide variety of initial asymptotic density slopes, orbital energies, and encounter configurations, including sequences of consecutive merger events, simultaneous mergers of several systems, and mergers of halos with embedded cold baryonic components in the form of disks, spheroids, or both. As an immediate consequence, the net effect of gas cooling, which contracts and steepens the inner density profiles of DM halos, should be preserved through a period of dissipationless major merging. Our results imply that the characteristic universal shape of DM density profiles may be set early in the evolution of halos.}

        abstract={Cold dark matter (CDM) is a well established paradigm to describe cosmological structure formation, and works extraordinarily well on large, linear, scales. Progressing further in dark matter physics requires being able to understand structure formation in the non-linear regime, both for CDM and its alternatives. This short note describes a calculation, and accompanying code, WarmAndFuzzy, incorporating the popular models of warm and fuzzy dark matter (WDM and FDM) into the standard halo model to compute the non-linear matter power spectrum. The FDM halo model power spectrum has not been computed before. The FDM implementation models ultralight axions and other scalar fields with $m_a\approx 10^{-22}$ eV. The WDM implementation models thermal WDM with mass $m_X\approx 1$ keV. The halo model shows that differences between WDM, FDM, and CDM survive at low redshifts in the quasi-linear and fully non-linear regimes. The code uses analytic transfer functions for the linear power spectrum, modified collapse barriers in the halo mass function, and a modified concentration-mass relationship for the halo density profiles. Modified halo density profiles (for example, cores) are not included, but are under development. Cores are expected to have very minor effects on the power spectrum on observable scales. Applications of this code to the Lyman-α forest flux power spectrum and the cosmic microwavv
e background lensing power spectrum will be discussed in companion papers. \textsc{WarmAndFuzzy} is available online at \url{https://github.com/DoddyPhysics/HMcode}, where collaboration in development is welcomed.}

To fully understand this relation, we have assembled a large sample of cored haloes based on both idealized soliton mergers and cosmological simulations with various box sizes. We find that there exists a sizeable dispersion in the core-halo mass relation that increases with halo mass, indicating that the FDM model allows cores and haloes to coexist in diverse configurations. We provide a new empirical equation for a core-halo mass relation with uncertainties that can encompass all previously found relations in the dispersion, and emphasize that any observational constraints on the particle mass m using a tight one-to-one core-halo mass relation should suffer from an additional uncertainty of the order of 50 per cent for halo masses \$\{rsim\} 10{\textasciicircum}9 {\textbackslash}, [8{\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}\{-23\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{eV\}/(mc{\textasciicircum}2)]{\textasciicircum}\{3/2\} {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}mathrm\{M\}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$.
