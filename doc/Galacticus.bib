collisional and 9 radiative processes and is applicable for temperatures
in the range 1 K {\textless} T {\textless} 10{\textasciicircum}8 K. In a companion paper {(Anninos} et
al., {1997)[NewA,} 2, 209] numerical methods are presented that unify the
modeling of non-equilibrium primordial gas chemistry and cooling
dicussed here with cosmological hydrodynamics. We derived new fits of
rate coefficients for the photo-attachment of neutral hydrogen, the
formation of molecular hydrogen via H{\textasciicircum}-, charge exchange between H\_2 and
H{\textasciicircum}+, electron detachment of H{\textasciicircum}- by neutral hydrogen, dissociative
recombination of H\_2{\textasciicircum}+ with slow electrons, photodissociation of H\_2{\textasciicircum}+,
and photodissociation of H\_2. Furthermore it was found that the
molecular hydrogen produced through the gas-phase processes, H\_2{\textasciicircum}+ + H
--{\textgreater} H\_2 + H{\textasciicircum}+, and H{\textasciicircum}- + H --{\textgreater} H\_2 + e{\textasciicircum}-, is likely to be
converted into its para configuration on a faster time scale than the
formation time. We have tested the model extensively and shown it to
agree well with former studies. We further studied the chemical kinetics
in great detail and devised a minimal model which is substantially
simpler than the full reaction network but predicts correct abundances.
This minimal model shows convincingly that 12 collisional processes are
sufficient to model the H, He, H{\textasciicircum}+, H{\textasciicircum}-, He{\textasciicircum}+, He{\textasciicircum}++, and H\_2 abundances
in low density primordial gas for applications with no radiation fields.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the Sixth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. With this data release, the imaging of the northern Galactic cap is now complete. The survey contains images and parameters of roughly 287 million objects over 9583 deg2, including scans over a large range of Galactic latitudes and longitudes. The survey also includes 1.27 million spectra of stars, galaxies, quasars, and blank sky (for sky subtraction) selected over 7425 deg2 . This release includes much more stellar spectroscopy than was available in previous data releases and also includes detailed estimates of stellar temperatures, gravities, and metallicities. The results of improved photometric calibration are now available, with uncertainties of roughly 1\% in g, r, i, and z, and 2\% in u, substantially better than the uncertainties in previous data releases. The spectra in this data release have improved wavelength and flux calibration, especially in the extreme blue and extreme red, leading to the qualitatively better determination of stellar types and radial velocities. The spectrophotometric fluxes are now tied to point-spread function magnitudes of stars rather than fiber magnitudes. This gives more robust results in the presence of seeing variations, but also implies a change in the spectrophotometric scale, which is now brighter by roughly 0.35 mag. Systematic errors in the velocity dispersions of galaxies have been fixed, and the results of two independent codes for determining spectral classifications and redshifts are made available. Additional spectral outputs are made available, including calibrated spectra from individual 15 minute exposures and the sky spectrum subtracted from each exposure. We also quantify a recently recognized underestimation of the brightnesses of galaxies of large angular extent due to poor sky subtraction; the bias can exceed 0.2 mag for galaxies brighter than r=14 mag.},

	abstract = {We use the Millennium Simulation, a large, high-resolution N-body
simulation of the evolution of structure in a Λ cold dark matter
cosmology, to study the properties and fate of substructures within a
large sample of dark matter haloes. We find that the subhalo mass
function departs significantly from a power law at the high-mass end. We
also find that the radial and angular distributions of substructures
depend on subhalo mass. In particular, high-mass subhaloes tend to be
less radially concentrated and to have angular distributions closer to
the direction perpendicular to the spin of the host halo than their less
massive counterparts. We find that mergers between subhaloes occur.
These tend to be between substructures that were already dynamically
associated before accretion into the main halo. For subhaloes larger
than 0.001 times the mass of the host halo, it is more likely that the
subhalo will merge with the central or main subhalo than with another
subhalo larger than itself. For lower masses, subhalo-subhalo mergers
become equally likely to mergers with the main subhalo. Our results have
implications for the variation of galaxy properties with environment and
for the treatment of mergers in galaxy formation models.},

computed. The number density of peaks subject to the constraint that the
large-scale density field be fixed is determined and used to discuss the

	abstract = {We study the constraints that high-redshift structure formation in the universe places on warm dark matter {(WDM)} dominated cosmological models. We modify the extended {Press-Schechter} formalism to derive the halo mass function in {WDM} models. We show that our predictions agree with recent numerical simulations at low redshift over the halo masses of interest. Applying our model to galaxy formation at high redshift, we find that the loss of power on small scales, together with the delayed collapse of low-mass objects, results in strong limits on the root-mean-square velocity dispersion vrms,0 of the {WDM} particles at redshift zero. For fermions decoupling while relativistic, these limits are equivalent to constraints on the mass {mX} of the particles. The presence of a {\textasciitilde}4{\texttimes}109 M solar supermassive black hole at redshift 5.8, believed to power the quasar {SDSS} 1044-1215, implies {mX{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.5} {keV} (or vrms,0{\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.10 km s-1), assuming that the quasar is unlensed and radiating at or below the Eddington limit. Reionization by redshift 5.8 also implies a limit on {mX.} If high-redshift galaxies produce ionizing photons with an efficiency similar to their redshift-three counterparts, we find {mX{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1.2} {keV} (or vrms,0{\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.03 s-1). However, given the uncertainties in current measurements from the proximity effect of the ionizing background at redshift three, values of {mX} as low as 0.75 {keV} (or vrms,0=0.06 s-1) are not ruled out. The limit weakens further to {mX{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.4} {keV} (or vrms,0{\textless}{\textasciitilde}0.14 s-1), if, instead, the ionizing-photon production efficiency is 10 times greater at high redshift, but this limit will tighten considerably if reionization is shown in the future to have occurred at higher redshifts. {WDM} models with {mX{\textless}{\textasciitilde}1} {keV} (or vrms,0{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}0.04 s-1) produce a low-luminosity cutoff in the high-redshift galaxy luminosity function that is directly detectable with the Next Generation Space Telescope, and which serves as a direct constraint on {mX.}},

	abstract = {We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between central galaxies and their host dark matter halos, as characterized by the stellar mass-halo mass {(SM-HM)} relation, with rigorous consideration of uncertainties. Our analysis focuses on results from the abundance matching technique, which assumes that every dark matter halo or subhalo above a specific mass threshold hosts one galaxy. We provide a robust estimate of the {SM-HM} relation for 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1 and discuss the quantitative effects of uncertainties in observed galaxy stellar mass functions (including stellar mass estimates and counting uncertainties), halo mass functions (including cosmology and uncertainties from substructure), and the abundance matching technique used to link galaxies to halos (including scatter in this connection). Our analysis results in a robust estimate of the {SM-HM} relation and its evolution from z = 0 to z = 4. The shape and the evolution are well constrained for z {\textless} 1. The largest uncertainties at these redshifts are due to stellar mass estimates (0.25 dex uncertainty in normalization); however, failure to account for scatter in stellar masses at fixed halo mass can lead to errors of similar magnitude in the {SM-HM} relation for central galaxies in massive halos. We also investigate the {SM-HM} relation to z = 4, although the shape of the relation at higher redshifts remains fairly unconstrained when uncertainties are taken into account. We find that the integrated star formation at a given halo mass peaks at 10\%-20\% of available baryons for all redshifts from 0 to 4. This peak occurs at a halo mass of 7 × 1011 M sun at z = 0 and this mass increases by a factor of 5 to z = 4. At lower and higher masses, star formation is substantially less efficient, with stellar mass scaling as M * {\textasciitilde} M 2.3 h at low masses and M * {\textasciitilde} M 0.29 h at high masses. The typical stellar mass for halos with mass less than 1012 M sun has increased by 0.3-0.45 dex for halos since z {\textasciitilde} 1. These results will provide a powerful tool to inform galaxy evolution models.},

	abstract = {We use a large sample of galaxies from the Two Micron All Sky Survey {(2MASS)} and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey {(SDSS)} to calculate galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions in the local universe. We estimate corrections for passband shifting and galaxy evolution, as well as present-day stellar mass-to-light {(M/L)} ratios, by fitting the optical-near-infrared galaxy data with simple models. Accounting for the 8\% galaxy overdensity in the {SDSS} early data release region, the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions we construct for this sample agree with most recent literature optical and near-infrared determinations within the uncertainties. We argue that {2MASS} is biased against low surface brightness galaxies and use {SDSS} plus our knowledge of stellar populations to estimate the ``true'' K-band luminosity function. This has a steeper faint end slope and a slightly higher overall luminosity density than the direct estimate. Furthermore, assuming a universally applicable stellar initial mass function {(IMF)}, we find good agreement between the stellar mass function we derive from the {2MASS/SDSS} data and that derived by Cole et al. The faint end slope for the stellar mass function is steeper than -1.1, reflecting the low stellar {M/L} ratios characteristic of low-mass galaxies. We estimate an upper limit to the stellar mass density in the local universe Ω*h=2.0+/-0.6×10-3 by assuming an {IMF} as rich in low-mass stars as allowed by observations of galaxy dynamics in the local universe. The stellar mass density may be lower than this value if a different {IMF} with fewer low-mass stars is assumed. Finally, we examine type-dependence in the optical and near-infrared luminosity functions and the stellar mass function. In agreement with previous work, we find that the characteristic luminosity or mass of early-type galaxies is larger than for later types, and the faint end slope is steeper for later types than for earlier types. Accounting for typing uncertainties, we estimate that at least half, and perhaps as much as 3/4, of the stellar mass in the universe is in early-type galaxies. As an aid to workers in the field, we present in an Appendix the relationship between model stellar {M/L} ratios and colors in {SDSS/2MASS} passbands, an updated discussion of near-infrared stellar {M/L} ratio estimates, and the volume-corrected distribution of g- and K-band stellar {M/L} ratios as a function of stellar mass.},

therefore, exert a braking torque on the black hole. Consequently, we
expect jet production to play a significant role in limiting the maximum
spin attainable by accreting black holes. We calculate the spin-up
function - the rate of change of black hole spin normalized to the black
hole mass and accretion rate - for an accreting black hole, accounting
for this braking torque. We assume that the accretion flow on to a Kerr
black hole is advection-dominated {(ADAF)} and construct easy-to-use
analytic fits to describe the global structure of such flows based on
the numerical solutions of Popham \& Gammie. We find that the
predicted black hole spin-up function depends only on the black hole
spin and dimensionless parameters describing the accretion flow. Using
recent relativistic magnetohydrodynamical {(MHD)} numerical simulation
results to calibrate the efficiency of angular momentum transfer in the
flow, we find that an {ADAF} flow will spin a black hole up (or down) to
an equilibrium value of about 96 per cent of the maximal spin value in
the absence of jets. Combining our {ADAF} system with a simple model for
jet power, we demonstrate that an equilibrium is reached at
approximately 93 per cent of the maximal spin value, as found in the
numerical simulation studies of the spin-up of accreting black holes, at
which point the spin-up of the hole by accreted material is balanced by
the braking torque arising from jet production. The existence of
equilibrium spin means that optically dim active galactic nuclei {(AGNs)}
that have grown via accretion from an advection-dominated flow will not
be maximally rotating. It also offers a possible explanation for the
tight correlation observed by Allen et al. between the Bondi accretion
rate and jet power in nine, nearby, X-ray luminous giant elliptical
galaxies. We suggest that the black holes in these galaxies must all be
rotating close to their equilibrium value. Our model also yields a
relationship between jet efficiency and black hole spin that is in
surprisingly good agreement with that seen in the simulation studies,
indicating that our simple model is a useful and convenient description
of {ADAF} inflow - jet outflow about a spinning black hole for
incorporation in semi-analytic modelling as well as cosmological
numerical simulation studies focusing on the formation and evolution of
galaxies, groups and clusters of galaxies.},

significant successes. In order to test current theories thoroughly we
require predictions for as yet unprobed regimes. To this end, we
describe a new implementation of the Galform semi-analytic model of
galaxy formation. Our motivation is the success of the model described
by Bower et al. in explaining many aspects of galaxy formation. Despite
this success, the Bower et al. model fails to match some observational
constraints and certain aspects of its physical implementation are not
as realistic as we would like. The model described in this work includes
substantially updated physics, taking into account developments in our
understanding over the past decade, and removes certain limiting
assumptions made by this (and most other) semi-analytic models. This
allows it to be exploited reliably in high-redshift and low mass
regimes. Furthermore, we have performed an exhaustive search of model
parameter space to find a particular set of model parameters which
produce results in good agreement with a wide range of observational
data (luminosity functions, galaxy sizes and dynamics, clustering,
colours, metal content) over a wide range of redshifts. This model
represents a solid basis on which to perform calculations of galaxy
formation in as yet unprobed regimes.},

	abstract = {A generic expectation for gas accreted by high mass haloes is that it is
shock heated to the virial temperature of the halo. In low mass haloes,
or at high redshift, however, the gas cooling rate is sufficiently rapid
that an accretion shock is unlikely to form. Instead, gas can accrete
directly into the centre of the halo in a `cold mode' of accretion.
Although semi-analytic models have always made a clear distinction
between hydrostatic and rapid cooling they have not made a distinction
between whether or not an accretion shock forms. Starting from the
well-established Galform code, we investigate the effect of explicitly
accounting for cold mode accretion using the shock stability model of
Birnboim \& Dekel. When we modify the code so that there is no
effective feedback from galaxy formation, we find that cold mode
accretion is the dominant channel for feeding gas into the galaxies at
high redshifts. However, this does not translate into a significant
difference in the star formation history of the universe compared to the
previous code. When effective feedback is included in the model, we find
that the the cold mode is much less apparent because of the presence of
gas ejected from the galaxy. Thus the inclusion of the additional cold
mode physics makes little difference to basic results from earlier
semi-analytic models which used a simpler treatment of gas accretion.
For more sophisticated predictions of its consequences, we require a
better understanding of how the cold mode delivers angular momentum to
galaxies and how it interacts with outflows.},

	abstract = {We compare the statistical properties of galaxies found in two different models of hierarchical galaxy formation: the semi-analytic model of Cole et al. and the smoothed particle hydrodynamics {(SPH)} simulations of Pearce et al. These two techniques model gas processes very differently: by approximate, analytic methods in the case of the semi-analytic model, and by direct numerical integration of the equations of hydrodynamics for a set of discrete particles in the case of {SPH.} Using a `stripped-down' version of the semi-analytic model which mimics the resolution of the {SPH} simulations and excludes physical processes not included in them, we find that the two models produce an ensemble of galaxies with remarkably similar properties, although there are some differences in the gas cooling rates and in the number of galaxies that populate haloes of different mass. The full semi-analytic model, which has effectively no resolution limit and includes a treatment of star formation and supernovae feedback, produces somewhat different (but readily understandable) results. Our comparison demonstrates that, on the whole, {SPH} simulations and semi-analytic models give similar results for the thermodynamic evolution of cooling gas in cosmological volumes. Agreement is particularly good for the present-day global fractions of hot gas, cold dense (i.e. galactic) gas and uncollapsed gas, for which the {SPH} and stripped-down semi-analytic calculations differ by at most 25per cent. In the most massive haloes, the stripped-down semi-analytic model predicts, on the whole, up to 50per cent less gas in galaxies than is seen in the {SPH} simulations. The two techniques apportion this cold gas somewhat differently amongst galaxies in a given halo. This difference can be tracked down to the greater cooling rate in massive haloes in the {SPH} simulation compared with the semi-analytic model. The galaxy correlation functions in the two models agree to better than about 50per cent over most pair separations and evolve with redshift in very similar ways. Our comparison demonstrates that these different techniques for modelling galaxy formation produce results that are broadly consistent with each other and highlights areas where further study is required.},

We use this model to predict the thermodynamic history of the {IGM} when photoionized by galaxies forming in a cold dark matter {(CDM)} universe. The evolution of the galaxies is calculated using a semi-analytical model, including a detailed treatment of the effects of tidal stripping and dynamical friction on satellite galaxies orbiting inside larger dark matter haloes. We include in the model the negative feedback on galaxy formation from the photoionizing background. Photoionization inhibits galaxy formation in low-mass dark matter haloes in two ways: (i) heating of the {IGM} and inhibition of the collapse of gas into dark haloes by the {IGM} pressure, and (ii) reduction in the rate of radiative cooling of gas within haloes. The result of our method is a self-consistent model of galaxy formation and the {IGM.} The {IGM} is reheated twice (during reionization of {HI} and {HeII),} and we find that the star formation rate per unit volume is slightly suppressed after each episode of reheating. We find that galaxies brighter than L* are mostly unaffected by reionization, while the abundance of faint galaxies is significantly reduced, leading to present-day galaxy luminosity functions with shallow faint-end slopes, in good agreement with recent observational data. Reionization also affects other properties of these faint galaxies, in a readily understandable way.},

Photoionization suppresses the formation of small galaxies, so that surviving satellites are preferentially those that formed before the Universe reionized. As a result, the number of satellites expected today is about an order of magnitude smaller than the number inferred by identifying satellites with subhaloes of the same circular velocity in high-resolution simulations of the dark matter. The resulting satellite population has an abundance similar to that observed in the Local Group, although the distribution of circular velocities differs somewhat from the available data. We explore many other properties of satellite galaxies, including their gas content, metallicity and star formation rate, and find generally good agreement with available data. Our model predicts the existence of many as yet undetected satellites in the Local Group. We quantify their observability in terms of their apparent magnitude and surface brightness, and also in terms of their constituent stars. A near-complete census of the Milky Way's satellites would require imaging to V{\textasciitilde}20 and to a surface brightness fainter than 26 V-band magnitudes per square arcsecond. Satellites with integrated luminosity V=15 should contain of order 100 stars brighter than B=26, with central stellar densities of a few tens per square arcminute.

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...599...38B},
	abstract = {We investigate the physical mechanisms that shape the luminosity function of galaxies in hierarchical clustering models. Beginning with the mass function of dark matter halos in the {LambdaCDM} {(Lambda} cold dark matter) cosmology, we show, in incremental steps, how gas cooling, photoionization at high redshift, feedback processes, galaxy merging, and thermal conduction affect the shape of the luminosity function. We consider three processes whereby supernovae and stellar wind energy can affect the forming galaxy: (1) the reheating of cold disk gas to the halo temperature; (2) expansion of the hot, diffuse halo gas; and (3) complete expulsion of cold disk gas from the halo. We demonstrate that while feedback of form 1 is able to flatten the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function, this process alone does not produce the sharp cutoff observed at large luminosities. Feedback of form 2 is also unable to solve the problem at the bright end of the luminosity function. The relative paucity of very bright galaxies can only be explained if cooling in massive halos is strongly suppressed. This might happen if thermal conduction near the centers of halos is very efficient, or if a substantial amount of gas is expelled from halos by process 3 above. Conduction is a promising mechanism, but an uncomfortably high efficiency is required to suppress cooling to the desired level. If, instead, superwinds are responsible for the lack of bright galaxies, then the total energy budget required to obtain a good match to the galaxy luminosity function greatly exceeds the energy available from supernova explosions. The mechanism is only viable if the formation of central supermassive black holes and the associated energy generation play a crucial role in limiting the amount of stars that form in the host galaxy. The models that best reproduce the galaxy luminosity function also give reasonable approximations to the {Tully-Fisher} relation and the galaxy autocorrelation function.},

We make detailed comparisons of analytically derived mass functions and merger histories with recent warm dark matter cosmological N-body simulations, and find excellent agreement. We show that, once the accretion of smoothly distributed matter is accounted for, coarse-grained statistics such as the mass accretion history of halos can be almost indistinguishable between cold and warm dark matter cases. However, the halo mass function and progenitor mass functions differ significantly, with the warm dark matter cases being strongly suppressed below the free-streaming scale of the dark matter. We demonstrate the importance of using the correct solution for the excursion set barrier first-crossing distribution in warm dark matter - if the solution for a flat barrier is used instead the truncation of the halo mass function is much slower, leading to an overestimate of the number of low mass halos.},

	abstract = {Dark matter halo merger trees are now routinely extracted from cosmological simulations of structure formation. These trees are frequently used as inputs to semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to provide the backbone within which galaxy formation takes place. By necessity, these merger trees are constructed from a finite set of discrete 'snapshots' of the N-body simulation and so have a limited temporal resolution. To date, there has been little consideration of how this temporal resolution affects the properties of galaxies formed within these trees. In particular, the question of how many snapshots are needed to achieve convergence in galaxy properties has not be answered. Therefore, we study the convergence in the stellar and total baryonic masses of galaxies, distribution of merger times, stellar mass functions and star formation rates in the {GALACTICUS} model of galaxy formation as a function of the number of 'snapshot' times used to represent dark matter halo merger trees. When utilizing snapshots between z= 20 and 0, we find that at least 128 snapshots are required to achieve convergence to within 5 per cent for galaxy masses, while 64 snapshots give convergence only to within 10 per cent for high-mass haloes. This convergence is obtained for mean quantities averaged over large samples of galaxies - significant variance for individual galaxies remains even when using very large numbers of snapshots. We find only weak dependence of the rate of convergence on the distribution of snapshots in time - snapshots spaced uniformly in the expansion factor, uniformly in the logarithm of expansion factor or uniformly in the logarithm of critical overdensity for collapse work equally well in almost all cases. We provide input parameters to {GALACTICUS} which allow this type of convergence study to be tuned to other simulations and to be carried out for other galaxy properties.},

Our sample spans halo masses ranging from dwarf galaxies to rich galaxy clusters. The very large dynamic range of this Lambda cold dark matter cosmological simulation enables the distribution of spins and shapes and their variation with halo mass and environment to be characterized with unprecedented precision. We compare results for haloes identified using three different algorithms, and investigate (and remove) biases in the estimate of angular momentum introduced both by the algorithm itself and by numerical effects. We introduce a novel halo definition called the {TREE} halo, based on the branches of the halo merger trees, which is more appropriate for comparison with real astronomical objects than the traditional `friends-of-friends' and `spherical overdensity' {(SO)} algorithms. We find that for this many objects, the traditional lognormal function is no longer an adequate description of the distribution, P(lambda), of the dimensionless spin parameter lambda, and we provide a different function that gives a better fit for {TREE} and {SO} haloes. The variation in spin with halo mass is weak but detectable, although the trend depends strongly on the halo definition used. For the entire population of haloes, we find median values of lambdamed = 0.0367-0.0429, depending on the definition of a halo. The haloes exhibit a range of shapes, with a preference for prolateness over oblateness. More-massive haloes tend to be less spherical and more prolate. We find that the more-spherical haloes have less coherent rotation in the median, and those closest to being spherical have a spin independent of mass (lambdamed {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.033). The most-massive haloes have a spin independent of shape (lambdamed {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.032). The majority of haloes have their angular momentum vector aligned with their minor axis and perpendicular to their major axis. We find a general trend for higher spin haloes to be more clustered, with a stronger effect for more-massive haloes. For galaxy cluster haloes, this can be larger than a factor of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde2.},

formation rate surface density, {ΣSFR,} and gas surface
density, Σgas, at sub-kpc resolution in a sample of 18
nearby galaxies. We use high-resolution H I data from The H I Nearby
Galaxy Survey, {CO} data from {HERACLES} and the {BIMA} Survey of Nearby
Galaxies, 24 μm data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, and {UV} data
from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer. We target seven spiral galaxies and
11 late-type/dwarf galaxies and investigate how the star formation law
differs between the H2 dominated centers of spiral galaxies,
their H I dominated outskirts and the H I rich late-type/dwarf galaxies.
We find that a Schmidt-type power law with index N = 1.0 ± 0.2
relates {ΣSFR} and {ΣH2} across our sample
of spiral galaxies, i.e., that H2 forms stars at a constant
efficiency in spirals. The average molecular gas depletion time is {\textasciitilde}2
× 109 years. The range of {ΣH2} over
which we measure this relation is {\textasciitilde}3-50 M sun
pc-2, significantly lower than in starburst
environments. We find the same results when performing a pixel-by-pixel
analysis, averaging in radial bins, or when varying the star formation
tracer used. We interpret the linear relation and constant depletion
time as evidence that stars are forming in giant molecular clouds with
approximately uniform properties and that {ΣH2} may be
more a measure of the filling fraction of giant molecular clouds than
changing conditions in the molecular gas. The relationship between total
gas surface density (Σgas) and {ΣSFR}
varies dramatically among and within spiral galaxies. Most galaxies show
little or no correlation between {ΣHI} and
{ΣSFR.} As a result, the star formation efficiency {(SFE),}
{ΣSFR/Σgas,} varies strongly across our
sample and within individual galaxies. We show that this variation is
systematic and consistent with the {SFE} being set by local environmental
factors: in spirals the {SFE} is a clear function of radius, while the
dwarf galaxies in our sample display {SFEs} similar to those found in the
outer optical disks of the spirals. We attribute the similarity to
common environments (low density, low metallicity, H I dominated) and
argue that shear (which is typically absent in dwarfs) cannot drive the
{SFE.} In addition to a molecular Schmidt law, the other general feature
of our sample is a sharp saturation of H I surface densities at
{ΣHI} ≈ 9 M sun pc-2 in
both the spiral and dwarf galaxies. In the case of the spirals, we
observe gas in excess of this limit to be molecular.},

	abstract = {Here we present the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog ({NYU-VAGC)}, a catalog of local galaxies (mostly below z{\textasciitilde}0.3) based on a set of publicly released surveys matched to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey ({SDSS)} Data Release 2. The photometric catalog consists of 693,319 galaxies, {QSOs}, and stars; 343,568 of these have redshift determinations, mostly from the {SDSS.} Excluding areas masked by bright stars, the photometric sample covers 3514 deg2, and the spectroscopic sample covers 2627 deg2 (with about 85\% completeness). Earlier, proprietary versions of this catalog have formed the basis of many {SDSS} investigations of the power spectrum, correlation function, and luminosity function of galaxies. Future releases will follow future public releases of the {SDSS.} The catalog includes matches to the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog and Extended Source Catalog, the {IRAS} Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey, the Two-Degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies, and the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey. We calculate and compile derived quantities from the images and spectra of the galaxies in the catalogs (for example, K-corrections and structural parameters for the galaxies). The {SDSS} catalog presented here is photometrically calibrated in a more consistent way than that distributed by the {SDSS} Data Release 2 Archive Servers and is thus more appropriate for large-scale structure statistics, reducing systematic calibration errors across the sky from {\textasciitilde}2\% to {\textasciitilde}1\%. We include an explicit description of the geometry of the catalog, including all imaging and targeting information as a function of sky position. Finally, we have performed eyeball quality checks on a large number of objects in the catalog in order to flag errors (such as errors in deblending). This catalog is complementary to the {SDSS} Archive Servers in that {NYU-VAGC's} calibration, geometric description, and conveniently small size are specifically designed for studying galaxy properties and large-scale structure statistics using the {SDSS} spectroscopic catalog.

different in high- and low-pressure regimes, defined by whether the gas

We investigate the nonlinear gravitational clustering of {WDM} with a high-resolution N-body code and identify a number of distinctive observational signatures. Relative to {CDM}, halo concentrations and core densities are lowered, core radii are increased, and large halos emerge with far fewer low-mass satellites. The number of small halos is suppressed, and those present are formed by ``top-down'' fragmentation of caustics, as part of a ``cosmic web'' connecting massive halos. Few small halos form outside this web. If we identify small halos with dwarf galaxies, then their number, spatial distribution, and formation epoch appear in better agreement with the observations for {WDM} than they are for {CDM.}},

	abstract = {We present a method that self-consistently tracks the growth of
supermassive black holes {(BHs)} and the feedback from active galactic
nuclei {(AGN)} in cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations. Our model is a
substantially modified version of the one introduced by Springel, Di
Matteo \& Hernquist implemented in a significantly expanded version
of the {GADGET} {III} code, which contains new prescriptions for star
formation, supernova feedback, radiative cooling and chemodynamics. We
simulate the growth of {BHs} from an initial seed state via
Eddington-limited accretion of the surrounding gas, and via mergers with
other {BHs.} Because cosmological simulations at present lack both the
resolution and the physics to model the multiphase interstellar medium,
they tend to strongly underestimate the {Bondi-Hoyle} accretion rate. To
allow low-mass {BHs} to grow, it is therefore necessary to increase the
predicted {Bondi-Hoyle} rates in star-forming gas by large factors, either
by explicitly multiplying the accretion rate by a numerical correction
factor or by using an unresolved, subgrid model for the gas close to the
{BH.} We explore the physical regimes where the use of such multiplicative
factors is reasonable, and through this introduce a new prescription for
gas accretion by {BHs.} Feedback from {AGN} is modelled by coupling a
fraction of the rest-mass energy of the accreted gas thermally into the
surrounding medium. We describe the implementation as well as the
limitations of the model in detail and motivate all the changes relative
to previous work. We demonstrate how general physical considerations can
be used to choose many of the parameters of the model and demonstrate
that the fiducial model reproduces observational constraints.

We employ a large suite of cosmological simulations, in which the
parameters of the {BH} model are varied away from their fiducial values,
to investigate the robustness of the predictions for the cosmic star
formation history and the redshift zero cosmic {BH} density, {BH} scaling
relations and galaxy-specific star formation rates. We find that the
freedom introduced by the need to increase the predicted accretion rates
by hand, the standard procedure in the literature, is the most
significant source of uncertainty. Our simulations demonstrate that
supermassive {BHs} are able to regulate their growth by releasing a fixed
amount of energy for a given halo mass, independent of the assumed
efficiency of {AGN} feedback, which sets the normalization of the {BH}
scaling relations. Regardless of whether {BH} seeds are initially placed
above or below the {BH} scaling relations, they grow on to the same
scaling relations. {AGN} feedback efficiently suppresses star formation in
high-mass galaxies.},

	abstract = {Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of the stellar mass of bright galaxies was already in place at z {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextgreater 1. This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation because massive haloes are assembled late in the hierarchical clustering process intrinsic to the cold dark matter {(CDM)} cosmology. In this paper, we discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei {(AGN)} is assumed to quench cooling flows in massive haloes. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy luminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the Millennium N-body simulation. The accurate dark matter merger trees and large number of realizations of the galaxy formation process enabled by this simulation result in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of the local galaxy population, we investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and galaxy stellar mass functions. We calculate the volume-averaged star formation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in which this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift z {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde 5 and a star formation rate density which rises at least out to z {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde 2 in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these properties have been cited as evidence for `antihierarchical' galaxy formation, we find that when {AGN} feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally hierarchical {CDM} model provides a very good match to these observations.},

	abstract = {The time-scale for galaxies within merging dark matter haloes to merge with each other is an important ingredient in galaxy formation models. Accurate estimates of merging time-scales are required for predictions of astrophysical quantities such as black hole binary merger rates, the build-up of stellar mass in central galaxies and the statistical properties of satellite galaxies within dark matter haloes. In this paper, we study the merging time-scales of extended dark matter haloes using N-body simulations. We compare these results to standard estimates based on the Chandrasekhar theory of dynamical friction. We find that these standard predictions for merging time-scales, which are often used in semi-analytic galaxy formation models, are systematically shorter than those found in simulations. The discrepancy is approximately a factor of 1.7 for {Msat/Mhost} {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.1 and becomes larger for more disparate satellite-to-host mass ratios, reaching a factor of {\textbackslash}textasciitilde3.3 for {Msat/Mhost} {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.01. Based on our simulations, we propose a new, easily implementable fitting formula that accurately predicts the time-scale for an extended satellite to sink from the virial radius of a host halo down to the halo's centre for a wide range of {Msat/Mhost} and orbits. Including a central bulge in each galaxy changes the merging time-scale by {\textbackslash}textless{\textbackslash}textasciitilde10 per cent. To highlight one concrete application of our results, we show that merging time-scales often used in the literature overestimate the growth of stellar mass by satellite accretion by {\textbackslash}textasciitilde40 per cent, with the extra mass gained in low mass ratio mergers.},

the normalizations for the virial relations and compare extensively to
the existing literature, finding remarkably good agreement. The

finding results consistent with other authors. We also examine related

1010 yr at a resolution of 3 Å across the whole

metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library
of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution
across a larger wavelength range, from 91 Å to 160 μm, at lower
resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution
theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally
pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by
observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar
populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed
optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star
clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in
the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for
the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the
Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra
from the Early Data Release {(EDR)} of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey

physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and
dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate
studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over
the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the {SDSS}

resolution allows a study of subhaloes inside host haloes. The profiles
are parametrized by an {NFW} form with two parameters, an inner radius
rs and a virial radius Rvir, and we define the
halo concentration {cvir≡Rvirrs.}
First, we find that, for a given halo mass, the redshift dependence of
the median concentration is cvir{\textasciitilde}(1+z)-1. This
corresponds to rs(z){\textasciitilde}constant, and is contrary to earlier
suspicions that cvir does not vary much with redshift. The
implications are that high-redshift galaxies are predicted to be more
extended and dimmer than expected before. Secondly, we find that the
scatter in halo profiles is large, with a 1σ
Δ(logcvir)=0.18 at a given mass, corresponding to a
scatter in maximum rotation velocities of
{ΔVmaxVmax=0.12.} We discuss implications for
modelling the {Tully-Fisher} relation, which has a smaller reported
intrinsic scatter. Thirdly, subhaloes and haloes in dense environments
tend to be more concentrated than isolated haloes, and show a larger
scatter. These results suggest that cvir is an essential
parameter for the theory of galaxy modelling, and we briefly discuss
implications for the universality of the {Tully-Fisher} relation, the
formation of low surface brightness galaxies, and the origin of the
Hubble sequence. We present an improved analytic treatment of halo
formation that fits the measured relations between halo parameters and

	abstract = {We present a new model for computing the effects of dust on the integrated spectral properties of galaxies, based on an idealized description of the main features of the interstellar medium {(ISM).} The model includes the ionization of H {II} regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the influence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of radiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of continuum radiation in the H {II} regions and the subsequent transfer of line and continuum radiation in the surrounding H I regions and the ambient {ISM.} This enables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of an ultraviolet-selected sample of nearby starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities, the ratio of Hα to Hβ luminosities, the Hα equivalent width, and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime of stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient for resolving an apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In addition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to λ-0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-infrared to ultraviolet luminosities and the ultraviolet spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow wavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the steepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In particular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical depths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation of all the observations. A noteworthy outcome of our detailed analysis is that the observed mean relations for starburst galaxies can be closely approximated by the following simple recipe: use an effective absorption curve proportional to λ-0.7 to attenuate the line and continuum radiation from each stellar generation, and lower the normalization of the curve, typically by a factor of 3 after 107 yr, to account for the dispersal of the birth clouds. This recipe or our full model for absorption can be incorporated easily into any population synthesis model.},

	abstract = {The importance of the radiative feedback from massive black holes at the
centers of elliptical galaxies is not in doubt, given the
well-established relations among electromagnetic output, black hole
mass, and galaxy optical luminosity. In addition, feedback due to
mechanical and thermal deposition of energy from jets and winds emitted
by the accretion disk around the central black hole is also expected to
occur and has been included in the work of several investigators. In
this paper, we improve and extend the accretion and feedback physics
explored in our previous papers to include also a physically motivated
model of mechanical feedback, in addition to radiative effects. In
particular, we study the evolution of an isolated elliptical galaxy with
the aid of a high-resolution one-dimensional hydrodynamical code, where
the cooling and heating functions include photoionization and Compton
effects, and restricting to models which include only radiative or only
mechanical feedback (in the form of nuclear winds). We confirm that for
Eddington ratios above 0.01 both the accretion and radiative output are
forced by feedback effects to be in burst mode, so that strong
intermittencies are expected at early times, while at low redshift the
explored models are characterized by smooth, very {sub-Eddington} mass
accretion rates punctuated by rare outbursts. However, the explored
models always fail some observational tests. If we assume the high
mechanical efficiency of 10-2.3 adopted by some
investigators, we find that most of the gas is ejected from the galaxy,
the resulting X-ray luminosity is far less than is typically observed
and little supermassive black hole {(SMBH)} growth occurs. But models with
low enough mechanical efficiency to accommodate satisfactory {SMBH} growth
tend to allow too strong cooling flows and leave galaxies at z = 0 with
{E+A} spectra more frequently than is observed. In a surprising
conclusion, we find that both types of feedback are required. Radiative
heating over the inner few kiloparsecs is needed to prevent calamitous
cooling flows, and mechanical feedback from active galactic nucleus
winds, which affects primarily the inner few hundred parsecs, is needed
to moderate the luminosity and growth of the central {SMBH.} Models with
combined feedback are explored in a forthcoming paper.},

	abstract = {We describe the {GALFORM} semi-analytic model for calculating the formation and evolution of galaxies in hierarchical clustering cosmologies. It improves upon, and extends, the earlier scheme developed by Cole et al. The model employs a new Monte Carlo algorithm to follow the merging evolution of dark matter haloes with arbitrary mass resolution. It incorporates realistic descriptions of the density profiles of dark matter haloes and the gas they contain; it follows the chemical evolution of gas and stars, and the associated production of dust; and it includes a detailed calculation of the sizes of discs and spheroids. Wherever possible, our prescriptions for modelling individual physical processes are based on results of numerical simulations. They require a number of adjustable parameters, which we fix by reference to a small subset of local galaxy data. This results in a fully specified model of galaxy formation which can be tested against other data. We apply our methods to the {LambdaCDM} cosmology {f12(M1,M2)} {dM1} [1/√2pi] [(deltac1 - deltac2)/ (sigma21 - sigma22)3/2] x exp [-(deltac1 - deltac2)2/ 2(sigma22)] {[dsigma21/dM1]} d M1 {(Omega0=0.3)} (df12)/(dt1 t1t2) {dM1} dt1 [1/√(2pi)] [1 / sigma21 - sigma22)3/2] [ddeltac1/dt1] {[dsigma21/dM1]} {dM1} dt1 Lambda0=0.7),-{\textbackslash}textgreater and find good agreement with a wide range of properties of the local galaxy population: the B- and K-band luminosity functions, the distribution of colours for the population as a whole, the ratio of ellipticals to spirals, the distribution of disc sizes, and the current cold gas content of discs. In spite of the overall success of the model, some interesting discrepancies remain: the colour-magnitude relation for ellipticals in clusters is significantly flatter than observed at bright magnitudes (although the scatter is about right), and the model predicts galaxy circular velocities, at a given luminosity, that are about 30per cent larger than is observed. It is unclear whether these discrepancies represent fundamental shortcomings of the model, or whether they result from the various approximations and uncertainties inherent in the technique.

Survey {(2dFGRS),} employing a direct Fourier method. The sample used
comprises 221414 galaxies with measured redshifts. We investigate in
detail the modelling of the sample selection, improving on previous

on revisions to the photometric calibration. The redshift selection

colour, and deducing a self-consistent treatment of k-corrections and
evolution for each population. The covariance matrix for the
power-spectrum estimates is determined using two different approaches to
the construction of mock surveys, which are used to demonstrate that the
input cosmological model can be correctly recovered. We discuss in
detail the possible differences between the galaxy and mass power
spectra, and treat these using simulations, analytic models and a hybrid
empirical approach. Based on these investigations, we are confident that
the {2dFGRS} power spectrum can be used to infer the matter content of the
universe. On large scales, our estimated power spectrum shows evidence
for the `baryon oscillations' that are predicted in cold dark matter
{(CDM)} models. Fitting to a {CDM} model, assuming a primordial
ns= 1 spectrum, h= 0.72 and negligible neutrino mass, the
preferred parameters are Ωmh= 0.168 +/- 0.016 and a

than the 0.20 +/- 0.03 in our 2001 analysis of the partially complete

	volume = {699},
	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...699..486C},
	abstract = {The stellar masses, mean ages, metallicities, and star formation
histories of galaxies are now commonly estimated via stellar population
synthesis {(SPS)} techniques. {SPS} relies on stellar evolution calculations
from the main sequence to stellar death, stellar spectral libraries,
phenomenological dust models, and stellar initial mass functions {(IMFs)}
to translate the evolution of a multimetallicity, multi-age set of stars
into a prediction for the time-evolution of the integrated light from
that set of stars. Each of these necessary inputs carries significant
uncertainties that have until now received little systematic attention.
The present work is the first in a series that explores the impact of
uncertainties in key phases of stellar evolution and the {IMF} on the
derived physical properties of galaxies and the expected luminosity
evolution for a passively evolving set of stars. A Monte Carlo Markov
Chain approach is taken to fit {near-UV} through {near-IR} photometry of a
representative sample of low- and high-redshift galaxies with this new
{SPS} model. Significant results include the following. (1) Including
uncertainties in stellar evolution, stellar masses at z {\textasciitilde} 0 carry errors
of {\textasciitilde}0.3 dex at 95\% {CL} with little dependence on luminosity or color,
while at z {\textasciitilde} 2, the masses of bright red galaxies are uncertain at the
{\textasciitilde}0.6 dex level. (2) Either current stellar evolution models, current
observational stellar libraries, or both, do not adequately characterize
the metallicity-dependence of the thermally pulsating {AGB} phase. (3)
Conservative estimates on the uncertainty of the slope of the {IMF} in the
solar neighborhood imply that luminosity evolution per unit redshift is
uncertain at the {\textasciitilde}0.4 mag level in the K band, which is a substantial
source of uncertainty for interpreting the evolution of galaxy
populations across time. Any possible evolution in the {IMF,} as suggested
by several independent lines of evidence, will only exacerbate this
problem. (4) Assuming a distribution of stellar metallicities within a
galaxy, rather than a fixed value as is usually assumed, can yield
important differences when considering bands blueward of V, but is not a
concern for redder bands. Spectroscopic information may alleviate some
of these concerns, though uncertainties in the stellar spectral
libraries and the importance of nonsolar abundance ratios have not yet
been systematically investigated in the {SPS} context.},

a viable mechanism for the production of elliptical galaxies, then merging must be
capable of producing these scaling relations. Previous studies have suggested that it is
diﬃcult to produce the observed slope and scatter of the early-type size-mass relation
via major mergers. We apply a simple theoretical merger model to galaxy progenitors
produced by two semi-analytical models, in order to derive scaling relations of merger
remnants. Importantly, our model includes the eﬀects of gaseous energy dissipation
and star formation. Using this model, and without tuning the parameters to each

A simple model in which the warm cloudy medium is the barrier that limits the expansion of blast waves reproduces the scaling of outflow properties with disk parameters at high star formation rates.

In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to be successful.},

luminosity and surface brightness. The structural parameters of the
galaxies were corrected for internal extinction using a description
depending on galaxy surface brightness. We find that the bivariate space
density distribution of spiral galaxies in the (luminosity, scale
size)-plane is well described by a Schechter luminosity function in the
luminosity dimension and a log-normal scale-size distribution at a given
luminosity. This parameterization of the scale-size distribution was
motivated by a simple model for the formation of disks within dark
matter halos, with halos acquiring their angular momenta through tidal
torques from neighboring objects and the disk specific angular momentum
being proportional to that of the parent halo. However, the fractional
width of the scale-size distribution at a given luminosity is narrower
than what one would expect from using the distribution of angular
momenta of halos measured in N-body simulations of hierarchical
clustering. We present several possible explanations for the narrowness
of the observed distribution. Using our bivariate distribution, we find
that determinations of the local luminosity function of spiral galaxies
should not be strongly affected by the bias against low surface
brightness galaxies, even when the galaxies are selected from
photographic plates. This may not be true for studies at high redshift,
where (1+z)4 surface brightness dimming would cause a
significant selection bias against lower surface brightness galaxies, if

The high star formation rates in these high-z progenitors are fuelled by rapid cooling, not by merger-triggered starbursts. We find that model {BCGs} assemble surprisingly late: half their final mass is typically locked up in a single galaxy after z {\textasciitilde} 0.5. Because most of the galaxies accreted on to {BCGs} have little gas content and red colours, late mergers do not change the apparent age of {BCGs.} It is this accumulation of a large number of old stellar populations - driven mainly by the merging history of the dark matter halo itself - that yields the observed homogeneity of {BCG} properties. In the second part of the paper, we discuss the evolution of {BCGs} to high redshifts, from both observational and theoretical viewpoints. We show that our model {BCGs} are in qualitative agreement with high-z observations. We discuss the hierarchical link between high-z {BCGs} and their local counterparts. We show that high-z {BCGs} belong to the same population as the massive end of local {BCG} progenitors, although they are not in general the same galaxies. Similarly, high-z {BCGs} end up as massive galaxies in the local Universe, although only a fraction of them are actually {BCGs} of massive clusters.},

increase in the random motions of the central part of the disk. It is
found that the cool disk component must have a low mass-to-light ratio,

	abstract = {We track the co-evolution of supermassive black holes {(SMBHs)} and their
host galaxies. The calculation is embedded in the {GALFORM}
semi-analytical model which simulates the formation and evolution of
galaxies in a cold dark matter {(CDM)} universe. During the evolution of
the host galaxy, hot and cold gas are added to the {SMBH} by flows
triggered by halo gas cooling, disc instabilities and galaxy mergers.
This builds up the mass and spin of the {BH,} and the resulting accretion
power regulates the gas cooling and subsequent star formation. The
accretion flow is assumed to form a geometrically thin cool disc when
the accretion rate exceeds {0.01{\textbackslash}dot{M}\_Edd,} and a geometrically thick,
radiatively inefficient hot flow when the accretion rate falls below
this value. The resulting quasar optical luminosity function matches
observations very well, and the mass of the {SMBH} correlates with the
mass of the galaxy bulge as observed. The {BH} spin distribution depends
strongly on whether the gas in any given accretion episode remains in
the same plane (prolonged accretion) or whether, due to self-gravity, it
fragments into multiple, randomly aligned accretion episodes (chaotic
accretion). In the chaotic accretion model there is a clear correlation
of spin with {SMBH} mass. Massive {BHs} {(M{\textgreater}5{\textbackslash}times10{\textasciicircum}8{\textbackslash}Msun)} are hosted
by giant elliptical galaxies and are rapidly spinning, while lower mass
{BHs} are hosted in spiral galaxies and have much lower spin. Using the
{Blandford-Znajek} mechanism for jet production to calculate the jet
power, our model is able to reproduce the radio loudness of radio
galaxies, {LINERS} and Seyferts. This is the first confirmation that a {CDM}

asymmetry, concentration, and central velocity dispersion as indicators
of morphological type, and are able to assess how the scale length

concentration and asymmetry parameters have to be used with caution when
investigating type dependence of structural parameters in galaxies.
Here, we present the scale length derivation method and numerous tests
that we have carried out to investigate the reliability of our results.
The average r-band disk scale length is 3.79 kpc, with an {RMS} dispersion
of 2.05 kpc, and this is a typical value irrespective of passband and
galaxy morphology, concentration, and asymmetry. The derived scale
lengths presented here are representative for a typical galaxy mass of
\$10{\textasciicircum}{10.8{\textbackslash}pm 0.54} {{\textbackslash}rm{M}\_{\textbackslash}odot\$,} and the {RMS} dispersion is larger for
more massive galaxies. Distributions and typical trends of scale lengths

another. Such transformations could be used to test the results of

We incorporate a model of the stripping process based on detailed hydrodynamic simulations within the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. The simulations show that the environment in groups and clusters is less aggressive than previously assumed. The main uncertainty in the model is the treatment of gas expelled by supernovae. With reasonable assumptions for the stripping of this material, we find that satellite galaxies are able to retain a significant fraction of their hot gas for several Gyr, thereby replenishing their reservoirs of cold, star-forming gas and remaining blue for a relatively long period of time. A bimodal distribution of galaxy colours, similar to that observed in Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, is established and the colours of the satellite galaxies are in good agreement with the data. In addition, our model naturally accounts for the observed dependence of satellite colours on environment, from small groups to high-mass clusters.},

	abstract = {We use two very large cosmological simulations to study how the density profiles of relaxed Lambda cold dark matter dark haloes depend on redshift and on halo mass. We confirm that these profiles deviate slightly but systematically from the {NFW} form and are better approximated by the empirical formula, d logrho/d logr {\textbackslash}textasciitilde ralpha, first used by Einasto to fit star counts in the Milky Way. The best-fitting value of the additional shape parameter, alpha, increases gradually with mass, from alpha {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.16 for present-day galaxy haloes to alpha {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0.3 for the rarest and most massive clusters. Halo concentrations depend only weakly on mass at z = 0, and this dependence weakens further at earlier times. At z {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 3 the average concentration of relaxed haloes does not vary appreciably over the mass range accessible to our simulations {(M} {\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 3 � {1011h-1Msolar).} Furthermore, in our biggest simulation, the average concentration of the most massive, relaxed haloes is constant at 200{\textbackslash}textgreater {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 3.5-4 for 0 {\textbackslash}textless= z {\textbackslash}textless= 3. These results agree well with those of Zhao et al. and support the idea that halo densities reflect the density of the universe at the time they formed, as proposed by Navarro, Frenk \& White. With their original parameters, the {NFW} prescription overpredicts halo concentrations at high redshift. This shortcoming can be reduced by modifying the definition of halo formation time, although the evolution of the concentrations of Milky Way mass haloes is still not reproduced well. In contrast, the much-used revisions of the {NFW} prescription by Bullock et al. and Eke, Navarro \& Steinmetz predict a steeper drop in concentration at the highest masses and stronger evolution with redshift than are compatible with our numerical data. Modifying the parameters of these models can reduce the discrepancy at high masses, but the overly rapid redshift evolution remains. These results have important implications for currently planned surveys of distant clusters.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004ApJ...616...16G},
	abstract = {The cooling of gas in the centers of dark matter halos is expected to lead to a more concentrated dark matter distribution. The response of dark matter to the condensation of baryons is usually calculated using the model of adiabatic contraction, which assumes spherical symmetry and circular orbits. In contrast, halos in the hierarchical structure formation scenarios grow via multiple violent mergers and accretion along filaments, and particle orbits in the halos are highly eccentric. We study the effects of the cooling of gas in the inner regions of halos using high-resolution cosmological simulations that include gas dynamics, radiative cooling, and star formation. We find that the dissipation of gas indeed increases the density of dark matter and steepens its radial profile in the inner regions of halos compared to the case without cooling. For the first time, we test the adiabatic contraction model in cosmological simulations and find that the standard model systematically overpredicts the increase of dark matter density in the inner 5\% of the virial radius. We show that the model can be improved by a simple modification of the assumed invariant from M(r)r to M(r)r, where r and r are the current and orbit-averaged particle positions. This modification approximately accounts for orbital eccentricities of particles and reproduces simulation profiles to within 10\%-20\%. We present analytical fitting functions that accurately describe the transformation of the dark matter profile in the modified model and can be used for interpretation of observations.},

	abstract = {High resolution cosmological N-body simulations of four galaxy-scale dark matter halos are compared to corresponding N-body/hydrodynamical simulations containing dark matter, stars and gas. The simulations without baryons share features with others described in the literature in that the dark matter density slope continuously decreases towards the center, with a density {rhoDM∝r-1.3�0.2,} at about 1\% of the virial radius for our Milky Way sized galaxies. The central cusps in the simulations which also contain baryons steepen significantly, to {rhoDM∝r-1.9�0.2,} with an indication of the inner logarithmic slope converging. Models of adiabatic contraction of dark matter halos due to the central buildup of stellar/gaseous galaxies are examined. The simplest and most commonly used model, by Blumenthal et al., is shown to overestimate the central dark matter density considerably. A modified model proposed by Gnedin et al. is tested and it is shown that, while it is a considerable improvement, it is not perfect. Moreover, it is found that the contraction parameters in their model not only depend on the orbital structure of the dark-matter only halos but also on the stellar feedback prescription which is most relevant for the baryonic distribution. Implications for dark matter annihilation at the galactic center are discussed and it is found that, although our simulations show a considerable reduced dark matter halo contraction as compared to the Blumenthal et al. model, the fluxes from dark matter annihilation are still expected to be enhanced by at least a factor of a hundred, as compared to dark-matter only halos. Finally, it is shown that, while dark-matter only halos are typically prolate, the dark matter halos containing baryons are mildly oblate with minor-to-major axis ratios of c/a=0.73�0.11, with their flattening aligned with the central baryonic disks.},

The simulations produce a detailed merging tree for the dark matter haloes, including complete knowledge of the statistical properties arising from the gravitational forces. We intend to predict the overall statistical properties of galaxies, with special emphasis on the panchromatic spectral energy distribution emitted by galaxies in the ultraviolet/optical and infrared/submillimetre wavelength ranges. In this paper, we outline the physically motivated assumptions and key free parameters that go into the model, comparing and contrasting with other parallel efforts. We specifically illustrate the success of the model in comparison with several data sets, showing how it is able to predict the galaxy disc sizes, colours, luminosity functions from the ultraviolet to far infrared, the {Tully-Fisher} and {Faber-Jackson} relations, and the fundamental plane in the local Universe. We also identify certain areas where the model fails, or where the assumptions needed to succeed are at odds with observations, and pay special attention to understanding the effects of the finite resolution of the simulations on the predictions made.

In addition to the source centroid positions, H I line flux densities, recessional velocities, and line widths, the catalog includes the coordinates of the most probable optical counterpart of each H I line detection, and a separate compilation provides a cross-match to identifications given in the photometric and spectroscopic catalogs associated with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7. Fewer than 2\% of the extragalactic H I line sources cannot be identified with a feasible optical counterpart; some of those may be rare {OH} megamasers at 0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.25. A detailed analysis is presented of the
completeness, width-dependent sensitivity function and bias inherent of the α.40 catalog. The impact of survey selection, distance errors, current volume coverage, and local large-scale structure on the derivation of the H I mass function is assessed. While α.40 does not yet provide a completely representative sampling of cosmological volume, derivations of the H I mass function using future data releases from {ALFALFA} will further improve both statistical and systematic uncertainties.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011arXiv1101.0002H},
	abstract = {We perform {3-D} dust radiative transfer {(RT)} calculations on hydrodynamic simulations of isolated and merging disk galaxies in order to quantitatively study the dependence of observed-frame submillimeter (submm) flux density on galaxy properties. We find that submm flux density and star formation rate {(SFR)} are related in dramatically different ways for quiescently star-forming galaxies and starbursts. Because the stars formed in the merger-induced starburst do not dominate the bolometric luminosity and the rapid drop in dust mass and more compact geometry cause a sharp increase in dust temperature during the burst, starbursts are very inefficient at boosting submm flux density (e.g., a \${\textbackslash}ga16\$x boost in {SFR} yields a \${\textbackslash}la 2\$x boost in submm flux density). Moreover, the ratio of submm flux density to {SFR} differs significantly between the two modes; thus one cannot assume that the galaxies with highest submm flux density are necessarily those with the highest bolometric luminosity or {SFR.} These results have important consequences for the submillimeter-selected galaxy {(SMG)} population. Among them are: 1. The {SMG} population is heterogeneous. In addition to the canonical scenario of merger-driven starbursts, there is a galaxy pair contribution in which two disks undergoing a major merger but not yet strongly interacting are blended into one submm source because of the large (\${\textbackslash}ga 15\$", or \${\textbackslash}sim 130\$ kpc at \$z = 2\$) beam of submm bolometers. 2. {SMGs} must be very massive {(\$M\_{{\textbackslash}star}} {\textbackslash}ga 6 {\textbackslash}times 10{\textasciicircum}{10} {\textbackslash}msun\$). 3. The infall phase makes the {SMG} duty cycle a factor of a few greater than what is expected for a merger-driven starburst. {(Abridged.)}},

	abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that the first generation of stars may have
been quite massive ({\textasciitilde}100-300 Msolar). Could these stars have
left a distinct nucleosynthetic signature? We explore the
nucleosynthesis of helium cores in the mass range {MHe=64-133}
Msolar, corresponding to main-sequence star masses of
approximately 140-260 Msolar. Above {MHe=133}
Msolar, without rotation and using current reaction rates, a
black hole is formed, and no nucleosynthesis is ejected. For lighter
helium core masses, {\textasciitilde}40-63 Msolar, violent pulsations occur,
induced by the pair instability and accompanied by supernova-like mass
ejection, but the star eventually produces a large iron core in
hydrostatic equilibrium. It is likely that this core, too, collapses to
a black hole, thus cleanly separating the heavy-element nucleosynthesis
of pair instability supernovae from those of other masses, both above
and below. Indeed, black hole formation is a likely outcome for all
Population {III} stars with main-sequence masses between about 25 and 140
Msolar {(MHe=9-63} Msolar) as well as
those above 260 Msolar. Nucleosynthesis in pair instability
supernovae varies greatly with the mass of the helium core. This core
determines the maximum temperature reached during the bounce. At the
upper range of exploding core masses, a maximum of 57 Msolar
of {56Ni} is produced, making these the most energetic and the
brightest thermonuclear explosions in the universe. Integrating over a
distribution of masses, we find that pair instability supernovae produce
a roughly solar distribution of nuclei having even nuclear charge {(Si,}
S, Ar, etc.) but are remarkably deficient in producing elements with odd
nuclear {charge-Na,} Al, P, V, Mn, etc. This is because there is no stage
of stable post-helium burning to set the neutron excess. Also,
essentially no elements heavier than zinc are produced owing to a lack
of s- and r-processes. The {Fe/Si} ratio is quite sensitive to whether the
upper bound on the initial mass function is over 260 Msolar
or somewhere between 140 and 260 Msolar. When the yields of
pair instability supernovae are combined with reasonable estimates of
the nucleosynthesis of Population {III} stars from 12 to 40
Msolar, this distinctive pattern of deficient production of
{odd-Z} elements persists. Some possible strategies for testing our
predictions are discussed.},

	abstract = {We compare the results of two techniques used to calculate the evolution of cooling gas during galaxy formation: smooth particle hydrodynamics {(SPH)} simulations and semi-analytic modelling. We improve upon the earlier statistical comparison of Benson et al. by taking halo merger histories from the dark matter component of the {SPH} simulation, which allows us to compare the evolution of galaxies on an object-by-object basis in the two treatments. We use a `stripped-down' version of the semi-analytic model described by Helly et al. that includes only shock heating and radiative cooling of gas and which is adjusted to mimic the resolution and other parameters of a comparison {SPH} simulation as closely as possible. We compare the total mass of gas that cools in haloes of different mass as a function of redshift and the masses and spatial distribution of individual `galaxies'. At a redshift of z= 0, the cooled gas mass in well-resolved haloes agrees remarkably well (to better than {\textbackslash}textasciitilde20 per cent) in the {SPH} simulation and stripped-down semi-analytic model. At high redshift, resolution effects in the simulation become increasingly important and, as a result, more gas tends to cool in low-mass haloes in the {SPH} simulation than in the semi-analytic model. The cold gas mass function of individual galaxies in the two treatments at z= 0 also agrees very well and, when the effects of mergers are accounted for, the masses of individual galaxies and their two-point correlation functions are also in excellent agreement in the two treatments. Thus, our comparison confirms and extends the earlier conclusion of Benson et al. that {SPH} simulations and semi-analytic models give consistent results for the evolution of cooling galactic gas.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new physical recipe into the De Lucia \& Blaizot
version of the Munich semi-analytic model built upon the Millennium dark
matter simulation: the tidal stripping of stellar material from
satellite galaxies during mergers.

To test the significance of the new physical process, we apply a Monte
Carlo Markov Chain parameter estimation technique constraining the model
with the K-band luminosity function, B - V colours and the black
hole-bulge mass relation. The differences in parameter correlations, and
in the allowed regions in likelihood space, reveal the impact of the new
physics on the basic ingredients of the model, such as the star
formation laws, feedback recipes and the black hole growth model.

With satellite disruption in place, we get a model likelihood four times
higher than in the original model, indicating that the new process seems
to be favoured by observations. This is achieved mainly due to a
reduction in black hole growth that produces a better agreement between
the properties of central black holes and host galaxies. Compared to the
best-fitting model without disruption, the new model removes the excess
of dwarf galaxies in the original recipe with a more modest supernova
heating.

The new model is now consistent with the three observational data sets
used to constrain it, while significantly improving the agreement with
observations for the distribution of metals in stars. Moreover, the
model now has predictions for the intra-cluster light, a very
significant component of large groups and clusters, that agree with
observational estimates.},

	abstract = {We present a statistical exploration of the parameter space of the De Lucia and Blaizot version of the Munich semi-analytic {(SA)} model built upon the Millennium dark matter simulation. This is achieved by applying a Monte Carlo Markov Chain method to constrain the six free parameters that define the stellar and black hole mass functions at redshift zero. The model is tested against three different observational data sets, including the galaxy K-band luminosity function, B - V colours and the black hole-bulge mass relation, separately and combined, to obtain mean values, confidence limits and likelihood contours for the best-fitting model. Using each observational data set independently, we discuss how the {SA} model parameters affect each galaxy property and find that there are strong correlations between them. We analyse to what extent these are simply reflections of the observational constraints, or whether they can lead to improved understandings of the physics of galaxy formation. When all the observations are combined, we find reasonable agreement between the majority of the previously published parameter values and our confidence limits. However, the need to suppress dwarf galaxy formation requires the strength of the supernova feedback to be significantly higher in our best-fitting solution than in previous work. To balance this, we require the feedback to become ineffective in haloes of lower mass than before, so as to permit the formation of sufficient high-luminosity galaxies: unfortunately, this leads to an excess of galaxies around L*. Although the best fit is formally consistent with the data, there is no region of parameter space that reproduces the shape of galaxy luminosity function across the whole magnitude range. For our best fit, we present the model predictions for the {bJ-band} luminosity and stellar mass functions. We find a systematic disagreement between the observed mass function and the predictions from the K-band constraint, which we explain in light of recent works that suggest uncertainties of up to 0.3 dex in the mass determination from stellar population synthesis models. We discuss modifications to the {SA} model that might simultaneously improve the fit to the observed mass function and reduce the reliance on excessive supernova feedback in small haloes.},

The amplitude of the primordial spectrum is measured to within 3\%, and there is now evidence for a tilt in the primordial spectrum at the 5sigma level, confirming the first detection of tilt based on the five-year {WMAP} data. At the end of the {WMAP} mission, the nine-year data decrease the allowable volume of the six-dimensional {LCDM} parameter space by a factor of 68,000 relative to pre-{WMAP} measurements. We investigate a number of data combinations and show that their {LCDM} parameter fits are consistent. New limits on deviations from the six-parameter model are presented, for example: the fractional contribution of tensor modes is limited to r\{\textless\}0.13 (95\% {CL);} the spatial curvature parameter is limited to -0.0027 (+0.0039/-0.0038); the summed mass of neutrinos is \{\textless\}0.44 {eV} (95\% {CL);} and the number of relativistic species is found to be 3.26+/-0.35 when the full data are analyzed. The joint constraint on Neff and the primordial helium abundance agrees with the prediction of standard Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We compare recent {PLANCK} measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect with our seven-year measurements, and show their mutual agreement. Our analysis of the polarization pattern around temperature extrema is updated.

	abstract = {Galaxies with stellar bulges are generically observed to host supermassive black holes {(SMBHs).} The hierarchical merging of galaxies should therefore lead to the formation of {SMBH} binaries. Merging of old massive galaxies with little gas promotes the formation of low-density nuclei where {SMBH} binaries are expected to survive over long times. If the binary lifetime exceeds the typical time between mergers, then triple black hole {(BH)} systems may form. We study the statistics of close triple {SMBH} encounters in galactic nuclei by computing a series of three-body orbits with physically motivated initial conditions appropriate for giant elliptical galaxies. Our simulations include a smooth background potential consisting of a stellar bulge plus a dark matter halo, drag forces due to gravitational radiation and dynamical friction on the stars and dark matter, and a simple model of the time evolution of the inner density profile under heating and mass ejection by the {SMBHs.} We find that the binary pair coalesces as a result of repeated close encounters in {\textasciitilde}85 per cent of our runs, and in {\textasciitilde}15 per cent of cases a new eccentric binary forms from the third {SMBH} and binary remnant and coalesces during the run time. In about 40 per cent of the runs the lightest {BH} is left wandering through the galactic halo or escapes the galaxy altogether, but escape of all three {SMBHs} is exceedingly rare. The triple systems typically scour out cores with mass deficits {\textasciitilde}one-two times their total mass, which can help to account for the large cores observed in some massive elliptical galaxies, such as M87. The high coalescence rate, prevalence of very high-eccentricity orbits, and gravitational radiation `spikes' during close encounters in our runs, may provide interesting signals for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna {(LISA).}},

star formation rate {(SFR)} out to a redshift around unity is well
established. Beyond z{\textasciitilde}1 there is growing evidence that this evolution is
flat or even increasing, contrary to early indications of a turnover.
Some recent analyses of z{\textasciitilde}6 photometric dropouts are suggestive of a
decline from z=3 to z{\textasciitilde}6, but there is still very little constraint on
the extent of dust obscuration at such high redshifts. In less than a
decade, numerous measurements of galaxy {SFR} density spanning z=0 to as
high as z{\textasciitilde}6 have rapidly broadened our understanding of galaxy
evolution, and a summary of existing {SFR} density measurements is
presented here. This global star formation history compilation is found
to be consistent to within factors of about 3 over essentially the
entire range 0{\textless}{\textasciitilde}6, and it can be used to constrain the evolution
of the luminosity function {(LF)} for star-forming galaxies. The {LF}
evolution for star-forming galaxies has been previously explored using
optical source counts, as well as radio source counts at 1.4 {GHz,} and a
well-known degeneracy between luminosity evolution {[L{\textasciitilde}(1+z)Q]}

constraints from the global {SFR} density evolution with those from the
1.4 {GHz} radio source counts at submillijansky levels allows this
degeneracy to be broken and a best-fitting evolutionary form to be
established. The preferred evolution in a

Accounting for the observed distributions of quasar column densities and 
variation of {SED} shapes, as well as their dependence on luminosity, 
makes it possible to integrate the observations in a reliable manner and 
provides a baseline in redshift and luminosity larger than that of any

claims of a flattening in both the faint- and bright-end slopes with

	abstract = {We study galaxy mergers using a high-resolution cosmological {hydro/N-body} simulation with star formation and compare the measured merger timescales with theoretical predictions based on the Chandrasekhar formula. In contrast to Navarro et al., our numerical results indicate that the commonly used equation for the merger timescale given by Lacey and Cole systematically underestimates the merger timescales for minor mergers and overestimates those for major mergers. This behavior is partly explained by the poor performance of their expression for the Coulomb logarithm, ln(mpri/msat). The two alternative forms ln(1+mpri/msat) and 1/2ln[1+(mpri/msat)2] for the Coulomb logarithm can account for the mass dependence of merger timescale successfully, but both of them underestimate the merger timescale by a factor 2. Since ln(1+mpri/msat) represents the mass dependence slightly better, we adopt this expression for the Coulomb logarithm. Furthermore, we find that the dependence of the merger timescale on the circularity parameter ɛ is much weaker than the widely adopted power law ɛ0.78, whereas 0.94ɛ0.60+0.60 provides a good match to the data. Based on these findings, we present an accurate and convenient fitting formula for the merger timescale of galaxies in cold dark matter models.},

The yields are computed using an updated reaction rate network that includes the latest {NeNa} and {MgAl} proton capture rates, with the main result that between {\textasciitilde}6 to 30 times less Na is produced by intermediate-mass models with hot bottom burning. In low-mass {AGB} models we investigate the effect on the production of light elements of including some partial mixing of protons into the intershell region during the deepest extent of each third dredge-up episode. The protons are captured by the abundant {12C} to form a {13C} pocket. The {13C} pocket increases the yields of {19F,} {23Na,} the neutron-rich Mg and Si isotopes, {60Fe,} and {31P.} The increase in {31P} is by factors of {\textasciitilde}4 to 20, depending on the metallicity. Any structural changes caused by the addition of the {13C} pocket into the He-intershell are ignored. However, the models considered are of low mass and any such feedback is likely to be small. Further study is required to test the accuracy of the yields from the partial-mixing models. For each mass and metallicity, the yields are presented in a tabular form suitable for use in galactic chemical evolution studies or for comparison to the composition of planetary nebulae.},

	abstract = {We construct semi-analytic models for galaxy formation within the framework of a hierarchical clustering scenario for structure formation in the Universe. We use the algorithm of Kauffmann \& White to generate ensembles of merging histories for present-day dark matter haloes with a wide range of circular velocities. A galaxy is assumed to form from gas which cools and turns into stars at the centre of a halo until that halo merges with a more massive object. At this time the galaxy loses its source of new gas and becomes a non-dominant object within a larger group or cluster. Our methods thus enable us to `look inside' present dark matter haloes and investigate the formation, evolution and merging of the galaxies that they contain. We begin by investigating the properties of haloes with V\_c\_ = 220 km sˆ-1ˆ, and use the observed properties of our Milky Way system to tune the free parameters that regulate star formation, hydrodynamic feedback from supernovae and the transformation of discs into spheroids by mergers. We then show that the same parameters lead to good agreement between the properties of galaxies in a V\_c\_ = 1000 km sˆ-1ˆ halo and observational data on the Virgo cluster of galaxies. This model correctly reproduces the observed trends in the luminosity, colour, gas content and morphology of galaxies. Turning to an investigation of the properties of the galaxy population as a whole, we highlight a problem that arises when applying this model to a `standard' cold dark matter universe. If the zero-point of the {Tully-Fisher} relation is set by the properties of our Milky Way system, we find that standard {CDM} predicts too many haloes and results in a B-band luminosity density of the Universe that is a factor of 2 too high. The only apparent solution to this problem is to assume that many haloes remain observationally undetectable. We also compute the gas mass-luminosity relation for galaxies, the variation in galaxy morphology as a function of luminosity, star formation histories according to environment, the field galaxy luminosity function, and predictions for faint galaxy counts in the B and K bands. We conclude that, although it would be premature to attempt a detailed quantitative fit to specific cosmological models, the qualitative agreement between the data and the general picture that we present is already very encouraging.},

initial mass function {(IMF)} which is enriched in massive stars by a
factor of 2-3 relative to the Scalo solar neighborhood {IMF.} We have used
published surface photometry of spiral galaxies to analyze the star
formation histories of disks independent of their bulge properties. The
ratio of the current star formation rate {(SFR)} to the average past rate
increases from of order 0.01 in Sa galaxies to 1 in {Sc-Irr} disks. This
confirms that the pronounced change in the photometric properties of
spiral galaxies along the Hubble sequence is predominantly due to
changes in the star formation histories of disks, and only secondarily
to changes in the bulge/disk ratio. A comparison of current {SFRs} and gas
masses of the sample yields median timescales for gas consumption of
approximately 3 Gyr, in the absence of stellar recycling. However, a
proper time-dependent treatment of the gas return from stars shows that
recycling extends the gas lifetimes of disks by factors of 1.5-4 for
typical disk parameters. Consequently the current {SFRs} in many (but not
all) disks can be sustained for periods comparable to the Hubble time.},

determine the parameters of the simplest {LCDM} model. The power-law index
of the primordial power spectrum is n\_s=0.963+-0.012, a measurement that
excludes the scale-invariant spectrum by more than 3-sigma. The other
parameters, including those beyond the minimal set, are also improved
from the 5-year results. Notable examples of improved parameters are the
total mass of neutrinos, {sum(m\_nu){\textless}0.58eV,} and the effective number
of neutrino species, N\_eff=4.34+0.86-0.88, which benefit from better
determinations of the third peak and H0. We detect the effect of
primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new
test of big bang nucleosynthesis. We detect, and show on the map for the
first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot
and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of
physical processes at z=1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar
fluctuations. With the 7-year {TB} power spectrum, the limit on a rotation
of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has
improved to Delta(alpha)=-1.1+-1.3(stat)+-1.5(syst) degrees. We report a
significant detection of the {SZ} effect at the locations of known
clusters, and show that the current simulations and analytical
calculations overestimate the gas pressure, and do not reproduce the
observed gas pressure in clusters of galaxies. This result is consistent

	abstract = {A universal initial mass function {(IMF)} is not intuitive, but so far no
convincing evidence for a variable {IMF} exists. The detection of
systematic variations of the {IMF} with star-forming conditions would be
the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or
Galactic-field {IMF} is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a
change in the power-law index at only two masses: near
{0.5Msolar} and near {0.08Msolar.} Using this supposed
universal {IMF,} the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of
the {IMF} is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson
noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that
this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in
power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit
within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of
evidence for a variable {IMF} means that any true variation of the {IMF} in
well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter.
Determinations of the power-law indices α are subject to
systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The
systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star
{IMFs} for young star clusters are systematically steeper by
Δα{\textasciitilde}0.5 between 0.1 and {1Msolar} than the
Galactic-field {IMF,} which is populated by, on average, about {5-Gyr-old}
stars. The {MFs} in globular clusters appear to be, on average,
systematically flatter than the Galactic-field {IMF} {(Piotto} \&
Zoccali; Paresce \& De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient
white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of
associated low-mass stars {(Ibata} et al.; Méndez \& Minniti)
suggest a radically different {IMF} for this ancient population. Star
formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce
relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an
interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the
{IMF} as expected from theoretical arguments.},

        abstract = {We propose a simple theoretical model for star formation in which the
local star formation rate {(SFR)} in a galaxy is determined by three
factors. First, the interplay between the interstellar radiation field
and molecular self-shielding determines what fraction of the gas is in
molecular form and thus eligible to form stars. Second, internal
feedback determines the properties of the molecular clouds that form,
which are nearly independent of galaxy properties until the galactic
interstellar medium {(ISM)} pressure becomes comparable to the internal
giant molecular cloud {(GMC)} pressure. Above this limit, galactic {ISM}
pressure determines molecular gas properties. Third, the turbulence
driven by feedback processes in {GMCs} makes star formation slow, allowing
a small fraction of the gas to be converted to stars per free-fall time
within the molecular clouds. We combine analytic estimates for each of
these steps to formulate a single star formation law, and show that the
predicted correlation between {SFR,} metallicity, and surface densities of
atomic, molecular, and total gas agree well with observations.},

A Monte Carlo method for constructing representative histories of merger events leading to the formation of halos of a prescribed mass is also described. From the application of these results to the age distribution of rich clusters of galaxies, it is inferred that a high value of the density parameter (greater than about 0.5) is required to reproduce the substantial fraction of rich clusters that exhibit such substructure, if this substructure only persists for a time of 0.2 t(0) after a merger, where t(0) is the present age of the universe.},

	abstract = {High-resolution {(HR)} N-body resimulations of 15 massive (1014-1015 Msolar) dark matter {(DM)} haloes have been combined with the hybrid galaxy formation model {GALICS} to study the formation and evolution of galaxies in clusters, within the framework of the hierarchical merging scenario. This paper describes the {HR} resimulation technique used to build the {DM} halo sample and discusses its reliability. New features incorporated in {GALICS} include a better description of galaxy positioning after {DM} halo merger events, a more reliable computation of the temperature of the intergalactic medium as a function of redshift, which also takes into account the reionization history of the Universe, and a semi-analytic description of the ram pressure stripping of cold gas from galactic discs, suffered by galaxies during their motion through the diffuse hot intracluster medium. Within the multitude of available model results, we choose to focus here on the luminosity functions {(LFs),} morphological fractions and colour distributions of galaxies in clusters and in cluster outskirts, at z= 0. No systematic dependence on cluster richness is found either for the galaxy {LFs,} morphological mixes, or colour distributions. Moving from higher density (cluster cores) to lower density environments (cluster outskirts), we detect a progressive flattening of the {LFs,} an increase of the fraction of spirals and a decrease of that of ellipticals and S0s, and the progressive emergence of a bluer tail in the distributions of galaxy colours, especially for spirals. As compared with cluster spirals, early-type galaxies show a flatter {LF,} and more homogeneous and redder colours. An overall good agreement is found between our results and the observations, particularly in terms of the cluster {LFs} and morphological mixes. However, some discrepancies are also apparent, with too faint magnitudes of the brightest cluster members, especially in the B band, and galaxy colours tending to be too red (or not blue enough) in the model, with respect to the observations. Finally, ram pressure stripping appears to affect very little our results.},

In order to fully exploit the information available from this regime and to extract cosmological constraints, accurate theoretical predictions are needed. Currently, such predictions can only be obtained from costly, precision numerical simulations. This paper is the third in a series aimed at constructing an accurate calibration of the nonlinear mass power spectrum on Mpc scales for a wide range of currently viable cosmological models, including dark energy models with w ≠ -1. The first two papers addressed the numerical challenges and the scheme by which an interpolator was built from a carefully chosen set of cosmological models. In this paper, we introduce the {"Coyote} Universe" simulation suite which comprises nearly 1000 N-body simulations at different force and mass resolutions, spanning 38 w {CDM} cosmologies. This large simulation suite enables us to construct a prediction scheme, or emulator, for the nonlinear matter power spectrum accurate at the percent level out to k {\textasciitilde}= 1 h Mpc-1. We describe the construction of the emulator, explain the tests performed to ensure its accuracy, and discuss how the central ideas may be extended to a wider range of cosmological models and applications. A power spectrum emulator code is released publicly as part of this paper.},

	abstract = {Using data from the {COSMOS} survey, we perform the first joint analysis of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, galaxy spatial clustering, and galaxy number densities. Carefully accounting for sample variance and for scatter between stellar and halo mass, we model all three observables simultaneously using a novel and self-consistent theoretical framework. Our results provide strong constraints on the shape and redshift evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass relation {(SHMR)} from z=0.2 to z=1. At low stellar mass, we find that halo mass scales as Mh M*{\textasciicircum}0.46 and that this scaling does not evolve significantly with redshift to z=1. We show that the dark-to-stellar ratio, {Mh/M*}, varies from low to high masses, reaching a minimum of {Mh/M*{\textasciitilde}27} at M*=4.5x10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun and Mh=1.2x10{\textasciicircum}12 Msun. This minimum is important for models of galaxy formation because it marks the mass at which the accumulated stellar growth of the central galaxy has been the most efficient. We describe the {SHMR} at this minimum in terms of the "pivot stellar mass", M*piv, the "pivot halo mass", Mhpiv, and the "pivot ratio", {(Mh/M*)piv.} Thanks to a homogeneous analysis of a single data set, we report the first detection of mass downsizing trends for both Mhpiv and M*piv. The pivot stellar mass decreases from M*piv=5.75+-0.13x10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun at z=0.88 to M*piv=3.55+-0.17x10{\textasciicircum}10 Msun at z=0.37. Intriguingly, however, the corresponding evolution of Mhpiv leaves the pivot ratio constant with redshift at {(Mh/M*)piv{\textasciitilde}27.} We use simple arguments to show how this result raises the possibility that star formation quenching may ultimately depend on {Mh/M*} and not simply Mh, as is commonly assumed. We show that simple models with such a dependence naturally lead to downsizing in the sites of star formation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in the context of popular quenching models, including disk instabilities and {AGN} feedback.},

I maps from The H I Nearby Galaxy Survey {(THINGS)} and derive
H2 maps of {CO} measured by {HERA} {CO-Line} Extragalactic Survey
and {Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland} Association Survey of Nearby Galaxies. We
estimate the {SFR} by combining Galaxy Evolution Explorer {(GALEX)}
far-ultraviolet maps and the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey
{(SINGS)} 24 μm maps, infer stellar surface density profiles from {SINGS}
3.6 μm data, and use kinematics from {THINGS.} We measure the {SFE} as a
function of the free fall and orbital timescales, midplane gas pressure,
stability of the gas disk to collapse (including the effects of stars),
the ability of perturbations to grow despite shear, and the ability of a
cold phase to form. In spirals, the {SFE} of H2 alone is nearly
constant at (5.25 ± 2.5) × 10-10
yr-1 (equivalent to an H2 depletion time of
1.9 × 109 yr) as a function of all of these variables
at our 800 pc resolution. Where the interstellar medium {(ISM)} is mostly
H I, however, the {SFE} decreases with increasing radius in both spiral
and dwarf galaxies, a decline reasonably described by an exponential
with scale length 0.2r 25-0.25r 25. We interpret
this decline as a strong dependence of giant molecular cloud {(GMC)}
formation on environment. The ratio of molecular-to-atomic gas appears
to be a smooth function of radius, stellar surface density, and pressure
spanning from the H2-dominated to H I-dominated {ISM.} The
radial decline in {SFE} is too steep to be reproduced only by increases in
the free-fall time or orbital time. Thresholds for large-scale
instability suggest that our disks are stable or marginally stable and
do not show a clear link to the declining {SFE.} We suggest that {ISM}
physics below the scales that we observe—phase balance in the H I,
H2 formation and destruction, and stellar
feedback—governs the formation of {GMCs} from H I.},

are locked up in stars. The projected autocorrelation function of
stellar mass is robustly and precisely determined for rp {\textless}
{30h-1Mpc.} Over the range 10h-1kpc {\textless}
rp {\textless} {10h-1Mpc,} it is extremely well represented
by a power law. The corresponding three-dimensional autocorrelation
function is ξ*(r) = {(r/6.1h-1Mpc)-1.84.}

implemented in six {Semi-Analytic} Models {(SAMs)} of galaxy formation,
including a new model we propose in this paper. We use versions of the
models without feedback and apply them to dark matter haloes growing in
a cosmological context, which have final masses that range from
{10{\textasciicircum}{11}Msun} to {10{\textasciicircum}{14}Msun.} First, using simplified smoothly-growing
halo models, we demonstrate that the different algorithms predict
cooling rates and final cold gas masses that differ by a factor of {\textasciitilde}5
for massive haloes {({\textgreater}10{\textasciicircum}{12}Msun).} The algorithms are in better
agreement for less massive haloes because they cool efficiently and,
therefore, their cooling rates are largely limited by the halo accretion
rate. However, for less massive haloes, all the {SAMs} predict less
cooling than corresponding {1D} hydrodynamic models. Second, we study the
gas accretion history of the central galaxies of dark matter haloes
using merger trees. The inclusion of mergers alters the cooling history
of haloes by locking up gas in galaxies within small haloes at early
times. For realistic halo models, the dispersion in the cold gas mass
predicted by the algorithms is 0.5 dex for high mass haloes and 0.1 dex
for low mass haloes, while the dispersion in the accretion rate is about
two times larger. Comparing to cosmological {SPH} simulations, we find
that most {SAMs} systematically under-predict the gas accretion rates for
low-mass haloes but over-predict the gas accretion rates for massive
haloes. Although the models all include both "rapid" and "slow" mode
accretion, the transition between the two accretion modes varies between
models and also differs from the simulations. Finally, we construct a
new model that explicitly incorporates cold halo gas to illustrate that
such a class of models can better match the results from cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations.},

thin Lyman-alpha forest clouds and the rarer, optically thick Lyman

sources. We study the mean properties of primeval galaxies at high
redshift in four broad optical passbands, Un, B, G, and R.
Even if young galaxies radiated a significant amount of ionizing
photons, the attenuation due to the accumulated photoelectric opacity
along the path is so severe that sources beyond z approximately 3 will
drop out of the Un image together. We also show that the
observed {B-R} color of distant galaxies can be much redder than expected
from a stellar population. At z approximately 3.5, the blanketing by
discrete absorption lines in the Lyman series is so effective that
background galaxies appear, on average, 1 mag fainter in B. By z
approximately 4, the observed B magnitude increment due to intergalactic
absorption exceeds 2 mag. By modeling the intrinsic {UV} spectral energy
distribution of star-forming galaxies with a stellar population
synthesis code, we show that the {(B-R)AB} approximately 0
criterion for identifying 'flat-spectrum,' metal-producing galaxies is
biased against objects at z greater than 3. The continuum blanketing
from the Lyman series produces a characteristic staircase profile in the
transmitted power. We suggest that this cosmic Lyman decrement might be
used as a tool to identify high-z galaxies.},

substantially smaller than the scatter among other models in the

	abstract = {The Arecibo Legacy Fast {ALFA} ({ALFALFA)} survey has completed source extraction for 40\% of its total sky area, resulting in the largest sample of H I-selected galaxies to date. We measure the H I mass function from a sample of 10,119 galaxies with 6.2 {\textless} log ({M\_H} {I/M\_\{\&sun;\})} {\textless} 11.0 and with well-described mass errors that accurately reflect our knowledge of low-mass systems. We characterize the survey sensitivity and its dependence on profile velocity width, the effect of large-scale structure, and the impact of radio frequency interference in order to calculate the H I mass function with both the {1/V} max and {2DSWML} methods. We also assess a flux-limited sample to test the robustness of the methods applied to the full sample. These measurements are in excellent agreement with one another; the derived Schechter function parameters are phi* (h 3 70 Mpc-3 dex-1) = 4.8 ± 0.3 × 10-3, log (M {*/M} sun) + 2 log h 70 = 9.96 ± 0.02, and α = -1.33 ± 0.02. We find {Ω\_H} I = 4.3 ± 0.3 ×10-4 h -1 70, 16\% larger than the 2005 {HIPASS} result, and our Schechter function fit extrapolated to log ({M\_H} {I/M\_\{\&sun;\})} = 11.0 predicts an order of magnitude more galaxies than {HIPASS.} The larger values of {Ω\_H} I and of M * imply an upward adjustment for estimates of the detection rate of future large-scale H I line surveys with, e.g., the Square Kilometer Array. A comparison with simulated galaxies from the Millennium Run and a treatment of photoheating as a method of baryon removal from H I-selected halos indicate that the disagreement between dark matter mass functions and baryonic mass functions may soon be resolved.},

For galactic black hole candidates, the model naturally accounts for the
observed correlation of jet outflow with the black hole hard emission
state and predicts an association of strong jets with rapid black hole
rotation. When extended to the supermassive case, the model accounts for
the highest radio galaxy and quasar jet powers and provides additional
theoretical support for the ``spin paradigm,'' which asserts that
radio-loud quasars are produced by Kerr holes and radio-quiet ones by
Schwarzschild holes. In some cases, the angular momentum and energy
outflow in the jet may be large enough to alter significantly the

	abstract = {We develop a simple analytic model for the gravitational clustering of
dark matter haloes to understand how their spatial distribution is
biased relative to that of the mass. The statistical distribution of
dark haloes within the initial density field (assumed Gaussian) is
determined by an extension of the {Press-Schechter} formalism.
Modifications of this distribution caused by gravitationally induced
motions are treated using a spherical collapse approximation. We test
this model against results from a variety of N-body simulations, and
find that it gives an accurate description of a bias function, {b(M,} R,
{delta)=delta\_h(M,} R, delta)/delta, where {delta\_h(M,} R, delta) is the
mean overdensity of haloes of mass M within spheres which have radius R
and mass overdensity delta the results depend only very weakly on how
haloes are identified in the simulations. This bias function is
sufficient to calculate the cross-correlation between dark haloes and
mass, and again we find excellent agreement between simulation results
and analytic predictions. Because haloes are spatially exclusive, the
variance in the count of objects within spheres of fixed radius and
overdensity is significantly smaller than the Poisson value. This
seriously complicates any analytic calculation of the autocorrelation
function of dark haloes. Our simulation results show, however, that this
autocorrelation function is proportional to that of the mass over a wide
range in R, even including scales where both functions are significantly
greater than unity. Furthermore, the constant of proportionality is very
close to that predicted on large scales by the analytic model. Since
analytic formulae for the non-linear autocorrelation function of the
mass are already known, this result permits an entirely analytic
estimate of the autocorrelation function of dark haloes. We use our
model to study how the distribution of galaxies may be biased with
respect to that of the mass. In conjunction with other data these
techniques should make it possible to measure the amplitude of cosmic
mass fluctuations and the density of the Universe.},

	abstract = {We study the population of galactic discs expected in current 
hierarchical clustering models for structure formation. A rotationally 
supported disc with exponential surface density profile is assumed to 
form with a mass and angular momentum which are fixed fractions of those 
of its surrounding dark halo. We assume that haloes respond 
adiabatically to disc formation, and that only stable discs can 
correspond to real systems. With these assumptions the predicted 
population can match both present-day discs and the damped Lyalpha 
absorbers in {QSO} spectra. Good agreement is found provided that: (i) the 
masses of discs are a few per cent of those of their haloes; (ii) the 
specific angular momenta of discs are similar to those of their haloes; 
(iii) present-day discs were assembled recently (at z{\textless}=1). In 
particular, the observed scatter in the size-rotation velocity plane is 
reproduced, as are the slope and scatter of the Tully-Fisher {(TF)} 
relation. The zero-point of the {TF} relation is matched for a stellar 
mass-to-light ratio of 1 to 2 h in the I-band, consistent with 
observational values derived from disc dynamics. High-redshift discs are 
predicted to be small and dense, and could plausibly merge together to 
form the observed population of elliptical galaxies. In many (but not 
all) currently popular cosmogonies, discs with rotation velocities 
exceeding 200 kms{\textasciicircum}-1 can account for a third or more of the observed 
damped Lyalpha systems at z{\textasciitilde}2.5. Half of the lines of sight to such 
systems are predicted to intersect the absorber at r{\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}3h{\textasciicircum}-1kpc and 
about 10 per cent at r{\textgreater}10h{\textasciicircum}-1kpc. The cross-section for absorption is 
strongly weighted towards discs with large angular momentum and 
therefore large size for their mass. The galaxy population associated 
with damped absorbers should thus be biased towards low surface 
brightness systems.},

	abstract = {We present the Model for the Rise of Galaxies and Active Nuclei {(MORGANA),} a new code for the formation and evolution of galaxies and active galactic nuclei {(AGNs).} Starting from the merger trees of dark matter {(DM)} haloes and a model for the evolution of substructure within the haloes, the complex physics of baryons is modelled with a set of state-of-the-art models that describe the mass, metal and energy flows between the various components (baryonic halo, bulge, disc) and phases (cold and hot gas, stars) of a galaxy. These flows are then numerically integrated to produce predictions for the evolution of galaxies. The processes of shock-heating and cooling, star formation, feedback, galactic winds and superwinds, accretion on to black holes and {AGN} feedback are described by new models. In particular, the evolution of the halo gas explicitly follows the thermal and kinetic energies of the hot and cold phases, while star formation and feedback follow the results of the multiphase model recently proposed by Monaco. The increased level of sophistication of these models allows to move from a phenomenological description of gas physics, based on simple scalings with the depth of the {DM} halo potential, towards a fully physically motivated one. We deem that this is fully justified by the level of maturity and rough convergence reached by the latest versions of numerical and semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. The comparison of the predictions of {MORGANA} with a basic set of galactic data reveals from the one hand an overall rough agreement, and from the other hand highlights a number of well- or less-known problems: (i) producing the cut-off of the luminosity function requires to force the quenching of the late cooling flows by {AGN} feedback, (ii) the normalization of the {Tully-Fisher} relation of local spirals cannot be recovered unless the {DM} haloes are assumed to have a very low concentration, (iii) the mass function of {HI} gas is not easily fitted at small masses, unless a similarly low concentration is assumed, (iv) there is an excess of small elliptical galaxies at z = 0. These discrepancies, more than the points of agreement with data, give important clues on the missing ingredients of galaxy formation.},

	abstract = {We investigate the metal enrichment of the intracluster medium {(ICM)}
within the framework of hierarchical models of galaxy formation. We
calculate the formation and evolution of galaxies and clusters using a
semi-analytical model which includes the effects of flows of gas and
metals both into and out of galaxies. For the first time in a
semi-analytical model, we calculate the production of both α and
iron-peak elements based on theoretical models for the lifetimes and
ejecta of type Ia and {II} supernovae {(SNe} Ia and {II).} It is essential to
include the long lifetimes of the {SNIa} progenitors in order to correctly
model the evolution of the iron-peak elements. We find that if all stars
form with an initial mass function {(IMF)} similar to that found in the
solar neighbourhood, then the metallicities of O, Mg, Si and Fe in the
{ICM} are predicted to be two to three times lower than the observed
values. In contrast, a model (also favoured on other grounds) in which
stars formed in bursts triggered by galaxy mergers have a top-heavy {IMF}
reproduces the observed {ICM} abundances of O, Mg, Si and Fe. The same
model predicts ratios of {ICM} mass to total stellar luminosity in
clusters which agree well with observations. According to our model, the
bulk of the metals in clusters are produced by L* and
brighter galaxies. We predict only mild evolution of {[Fe/H]} in the {ICM}
with redshift out to z{\textasciitilde} 1, consistent with the sparse data available on
high-z clusters. In contrast, the {[O/Fe]} ratio is predicted to gradually
decrease with time because of the delayed production of iron compared
with oxygen. We find that, at a given redshift, the scatter in global
metallicity for clusters of a given mass is quite small, even though the
formation histories of individual clusters show wide variations. The
observed diversity in {ICM} metallicities may thus result from the range
in metallicity gradients induced by the scatter in the assembly
histories of clusters of galaxies.},

The gas rotates at much less than the Keplerian angular velocity; therefore, the central stars in such flows will cease to spin up long before they reach the break-up limit. Further, the Bernoulli parameter is positive, implying that advection-dominated flows are susceptible to producing outflows. Convection is likely in many of these flows and, if present, will tend to enhance the above effects.

The spherically averaged density profiles of all our halos can be fitted over two decades in radius by scaling a simple "universal" profile. The characteristic over- density of a halo, or equivalently its concentration, correlates strongly with halo mass in a way that reflects the mass dependence of the epoch of halo formation. Halo profiles are approximately isothermal over a large range in radii but are significantly shallower than r -2 near the center and steeper than r-2 near the virial radius. Matching the observed rotation curves of disk galaxies requires disk mass-to-light ratios to increase systematically with luminosity. Further, it suggests that the halos of bright galaxies depend only weakly on galaxy luminosity and have circular velocities significantly lower than the disk rotation speed. This may explain why luminosity and dynamics are uncorrelated in observed samples of binary galaxies and of satellite/spiral systems. For galaxy clusters, our halo models are consistent both with the presence of giant arcs and with the observed structure of the intracluster medium, and they suggest a simple explanation for the disparate estimates of cluster core radii found by previous authors. Our results also highlight two shortcomings of the {CDM} model. {CDM} halos are too concentrated to be consistent with the halo parameters inferred for dwarf irregulars, and the predicted abundance of galaxy halos is larger than the observed abundance of galaxies. The first problem may imply that the core structure of dwarf galaxies was altered by the galaxy formation process, and the second problem may imply that galaxies failed to form (or remain undetected) in many dark halos.},

	abstract = {We use high-resolution N-body simulations to study the equilibrium density profiles of dark matter halos in hierarchically clustering universes. We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the {Press-Schechter} formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

are proportional to \${\textbackslash}eta\$, and many prior treatments have essentially
assumed that \${\textbackslash}eta=0\$. We perform one- and two-dimensional simulations
and find that the growth of the central {SMBH} is very sensitive to the
inclusion of the mass and momentum driving but is insensitive to the
assumed mechanical efficiency. For example in representative
calculations, the omission of momentum and mass feedback leads to an
hundred fold increase in the mass of the {SMBH} to over \$10{\textasciicircum}{10} {{\textbackslash}Msun\$.}

Among the most important are that no singularities at early times appear, which avoids numerical problems in particular in applications to cosmologies with dynamical and early dark energy, and that the assumption of time-reversal symmetry can easily be dropped where it is not strictly satisfied. We use this approach to derive the two parameters characterising the spherical-collapse model, i.e.{\textasciitilde}the linear density threshold for collapse \${\textbackslash}delta\_{\textbackslash}mathrm{c}\$ and the virial overdensity {\${\textbackslash}Delta\_{\textbackslash}mathrm{V}\$,} for a broad variety of dark-energy models and to reconsider these parameters in cosmologies with early dark energy.

The new data constrain the power spectrum on scales 100-600 h-1 Mpc with significantly higher precision than previous analyses of just the {SDSS} main galaxies, due to our larger sample and the inclusion of the {LRGs.} This improvement means that we can now reveal a discrepancy between the shape of the measured power and linear {CDM} models on scales 0.01 h Mpc-1{\textbackslash}textless0.15 h Mpc-1, with linear model fits favoring a lower matter density ({OmegaM=0.22+/-0.04)} on scales 0.01 h Mpc-1{\textbackslash}textless0.06 h Mpc-1 and a higher matter density ({OmegaM=0.32+/-0.01)} when smaller scales are included, assuming a flat {LambdaCDM} model with h=0.73 and ns=0.96. This discrepancy could be explained by scale-dependent bias, and by analyzing subsamples of galaxies, we find that the ratio of small-scale to large-scale power increases with galaxy luminosity, so all of the {SDSS} galaxies cannot trace the same power spectrum shape over 0.01 h Mpc-1{\textbackslash}textless0.2 h Mpc-1.

constraints for theoretical models of galaxy formation. The input sample
of 234 galaxies has a roughly flat distribution of absolute magnitudes
in the range -18.5 {\textgreater} Mr {\textgreater} -22, and our only
morphological selection is an isophotal axis ratio cut b/a {\textless} 0.6 to
allow accurate inclination corrections. Long-slit spectroscopy from the
Calar Alto and {MDM} observatories yields usable Hα rotation curves
for 162 galaxies (69\%), with a representative color and morphology
distribution. We define circular velocities V80 by evaluating
the rotation curve at the radius containing 80\% of the i-band light.
Observational errors, including estimated distance errors due to
peculiar velocities, are small compared to the intrinsic scatter of the
{TF} relation. The slope of the forward {TF} relation steepens from -5.5
± 0.2 mag (log10 km s-1)-1 in
the g band to -6.6 ± 0.2 mag (log10 km
s-1)-1 in the z band. The intrinsic scatter is
σ approx 0.4 mag in all bands, and residuals from either the
forward or inverse relations have an approximately Gaussian
distribution. We discuss how Malmquist-type biases may affect the
observed slope, intercept, and scatter. The scatter is not dominated by
rare outliers or by any particular class of galaxies, although it drops
slightly, to σ approx 0.36 mag, if we restrict the sample to
nearly bulgeless systems. Correlations of {TF} residuals with other galaxy
properties are weak: bluer galaxies are significantly brighter than
average in the g-band {TF} relation but only marginally brighter in the i
band; more concentrated (earlier type) galaxies are slightly fainter
than average, and the {TF} residual is virtually independent of half-light
radius, contrary to the trend expected for gravitationally dominant
disks. The observed residual correlations do not account for most of the
intrinsic scatter, implying that this scatter is instead driven largely
by variations in the ratio of dark to luminous matter within the disk

	abstract = {Black holes grow by accreting matter from their surroundings. However, angular momentum provides an efficient natural barrier to accretion and so only the lowest angular momentum material will be available to feed the black holes. The standard modelling of black hole growth in galaxy formation simulations (based on the {Bondi-Hoyle} method) takes no account of the angular momentum of accreting material, and so it is unclear how representative the estimated accretion rates in these simulations are likely to be. In this paper we introduce a new method for estimating the black hole accretion rate {(dM/dt)\_BH} that explicitly accounts for the angular momentum of accreting material. We model both the black hole and its accretion disc as a composite accretion disc particle. Gas particles are accreted by the accretion disc particle if and only if their orbits bring them within its accretion radius R\_acc. The gas mass is then added to the accretion disc and is available to feed the black hole on a viscous timescale t\_visc. The resulting {(dM/dt)\_BH} powers the accretion luminosity L\_acc {\textasciitilde} {(dM/dt)\_BH,} which in turn drives feedback from the black hole. Through a series of controlled numerical experiments we demonstrate that our new accretion disc particle method is far more physically self-consistent than the {Bondi-Hoyle} method. We also discuss the physical implications of the accretion disc particle method for systems with a high degree of rotational support, and we argue that the {M\_BH-sigma} relation in these systems should be offset from the relation for classical bulges and ellipticals, as appears to be observed.},

that the model predictions are broadly consistent with one another; the
key differences reflect how the models treat active galactic nuclei
feedback and how the time-scale for star formation evolves with
redshift. The models produce mass functions of cold gas in galaxies that
are generally in good agreement with {HI} surveys at . Interestingly, we
find that these mass functions do not evolve significantly with
redshift. Adopting a simple conversion factor for cold gas mass to {HI}
mass that we apply to all galaxies at all redshifts, we derive mass
functions of {HI} in galaxies from the predicted mass functions of cold
gas, which we use to predict the number counts of sources likely to be
detected by {HI} surveys on next generation radio telescopes such as the
Square Kilometre Array and its pathfinders. We find the number counts
peak at galaxies deg at for a year long {HI} hemispheric survey on a
1/10/100 per cent {SKA} with a 30 deg field of view, corresponding to an
integration time of 12 h. On a full {SKA} with a 200 deg field of view
(equivalent to an integration time of 80 h) the number counts peak at
galaxies deg at . We show also how adopting a conversion factor for cold
gas mass to {HI} mass that varies from galaxy to galaxy impacts on number
counts. In addition, we examine how the typical angular sizes of
galaxies vary with redshift. These decline strongly with increasing
redshift at and more gently at ; the median angular size varies between
5 and 10 arcsec at , 0.5 and 3 arcsec at and 0.2 and 1 arcsec at for
galaxies with {HI} masses in excess of , depending on the precise model.
Taken together, these results make clear that the forthcoming {HI} surveys
will provide important and powerful tests of theoretical galaxy
formation models.},

	abstract = {We study the concentration of dark matter halos and its evolution in N-body simulations of the standard {LCDM} cosmology. The results presented in this paper are based on 4 large N-body simulations with about 10 billion particles each: the {Millennium-I} and {II}, Bolshoi, and {MultiDark} simulations. The {MultiDark} (or {BigBolshoi)} simulation is introduced in this paper. This suite of simulations with high mass resolution over a large volume allows us to compute with unprecedented accuracy the concentration over a large range of scales (about six orders of magnitude in mass), which constitutes the state-of-the-art of our current knowledge on this basic property of dark matter halos in the {LCDM} cosmology. We find that there is consistency among the different simulation data sets. We confirm a novel feature for halo concentrations at high redshifts: a flattening and upturn with increasing mass. The concentration {c(M},z) as a function of mass and the redshift and for different cosmological parameters shows a remarkably complex pattern. However, when expressed in terms of the linear rms fluctuation of the density field {sigma(M},z), the halo concentration c(sigma) shows a nearly-universal simple U-shaped behaviour with a minimum at a well defined scale at sigma=0.71. Yet, some small dependences with redshift and cosmology still remain. At the high-mass end (sigma {\textless} 1) the median halo kinematic profiles show large signatures of infall and highly radial orbits. This {c-sigma(M},z) relation can be accurately parametrized and provides an analytical model for the dependence of concentration on halo mass. When applied to galaxy clusters, our estimates of concentrations are substantially larger -- by a factor up to 1.5 -- than previous results from smaller simulations, and are in much better agreement with results of observations.

	abstract = {Our heuristic understanding of the abundance of dark matter halos
centers around the concept of a density threshold, or "barrier," for
gravitational collapse. If one adopts the ansatz that regions of the
linearly evolved density field smoothed on mass scale M with an
overdensity that exceeds the barrier will undergo gravitational collapse
into halos of mass M, the corresponding abundance of such halos can be
estimated simply as a fraction of the mass density satisfying the
collapse criterion divided by the mass M. The key ingredient of this
ansatz is therefore the functional form of the collapse barrier as a
function of mass M or, equivalently, of the variance
{σ2(M).} Several such barriers based on the spherical,
Zel'dovich, and ellipsoidal collapse models have been extensively
discussed. Using large-scale cosmological simulations, we show that the
relation between the linear overdensity and the mass variance for
regions that collapse to form halos by the present epoch resembles
expectations from dynamical models of ellipsoidal collapse. However, we
also show that using such a collapse barrier with the excursion set
ansatz predicts a halo mass function inconsistent with that measured
directly in cosmological simulations. This inconsistency demonstrates a
failure of the excursion set ansatz as a physical model for halo
collapse. We discuss implications of our results for understanding the
collapse epoch for halos as a function of mass, and avenues for
improving consistency between analytical models for the collapse epoch
and the results of cosmological simulations.},

	abstract = {We examine the orbits of satellite galaxies identified in a suite of
N-body/gasdynamical simulations of the formation of L*
galaxies in a Lambda cold dark matter universe. The numerical resolution
of the simulations allows us to track in detail the orbits of the {\textasciitilde} 10
brightest satellites around each primary. Most satellites follow
conventional orbits; after turning around, they accrete into their host
halo and settle on orbits whose apocentric radii are steadily eroded by
dynamical friction. As a result, satellites associated with the primary
are typically found within its virial radius, rvir, and have
velocities consistent with a Gaussian distribution with mild radial
anisotropy. However, a number of outliers are also present. We find that
a surprising number (about one-third) of satellites identified at z = 0
are on unorthodox orbits, with apocentres that exceed their turnaround
radii. These include a number of objects with extreme velocities and
apocentric radii at times exceeding {\textasciitilde}3.5rvir (or, e.g. {\textgreater}{\textasciitilde}1
Mpc when scaled to the Milky Way). This population of satellites on
extreme orbits consists typically of the faint member of a satellite
pair whose kinship is severed by the tidal field of the primary during
first approach. Under the right circumstances, the heavier member of the
pair remains bound to the primary, whilst the lighter companion is
ejected on to a highly energetic orbit. Since the concurrent accretion
of multiple satellite systems is a defining feature of hierarchical
models of galaxy formation, a fairly robust prediction of this scenario
is that at least some of these extreme objects should be present in the
Local Group. We speculate that this three-body ejection mechanism may be
the origin of (i) some of the newly discovered high-speed satellites
around M31 (such as Andromeda {XIV);} (ii) some of the distant
fast-receding Local Group members, such as Leo I and (iii) the oddly
isolated dwarf spheroidals Cetus and Tucana in the outskirts of the
Local Group. Our results suggest that care must be exercised when using
the orbits of the most weakly bound satellites to place constraints on
the total mass of the Local Group.},

use multilevel atoms and evolve the population of each level with
redshift by including all bound-bound and bound-free transitions. In
this framework we follow several hundred atomic energy levels for H, He
I, and He {II} combined. The main improvements of this method over
previous recombination calculations are (1) allowing excited atomic
level populations to depart from an equilibrium distribution, (2)
replacing the total recombination coefficient with recombination to and
photoionization from each level calculated directly at each redshift
step, and (3) correct treatment of the He I atom, including the triplet
and singlet states. We find that
{xe(≡ne/nH)} is approximately 10\%
smaller at redshifts {\textless}{\textasciitilde}800 than in previous calculations, as a result
of the nonequilibrium of the excited states of H that is caused by the
strong but cool radiation field at those redshifts. In addition, we find
that He I recombination is delayed compared with previous calculations
and occurs only just before H recombination. These changes in turn can
affect the predicted power spectrum of microwave anisotropies at the few
percent level. Other improvements, such as including molecular and ionic
species of H, including complete heating and cooling terms for the
evolution of the matter temperature, including collisional rates, and
including feedback of the secondary spectral distortions on the
radiation field, produce negligible change to the ionization fraction.
The lower xe at low z found in this work affects the
abundances of H molecular and ionic species by 10\%-25\%. However, this
difference is probably not larger than other uncertainties in the

each type of galaxy, the size distribution at given luminosity (or
stellar mass) is well described by a log-normal function, characterized
by its median and dispersion {σlnR.} For late-type
galaxies, there is a characteristic luminosity at Mr,0{\textasciitilde}-20.5

M0 have and {σlnR{\textasciitilde}} 0.3, while less massive
galaxies have and {σlnR{\textasciitilde}} 0.5. For early-type galaxies,
the relation is significantly steeper, , but the {σlnR-M}
relation is similar to that of bright late-type galaxies. Faint red
galaxies have sizes quite independent of their luminosities. We use
simple theoretical models to interpret these results. The observed
relation for late-type galaxies can be explained if the fraction of
baryons that form stars is as predicted by the standard feedback model.
Fitting the observed {σlnR-M} relation requires in
addition that the bulge/disc mass ratio be larger in haloes of lower
angular momentum and that the bulge material transfers part of its
angular momentum to the disc. This can be achieved if bulge formation
occurs so as to maintain a marginally stable disc. For early-type
galaxies, the observed {σlnR-M} relation is inconsistent
with formation through single major mergers of present-day discs. It is
consistent with formation through repeated mergers, if the progenitors

It can also be used to describe density profiles, on scales larger than the virial radius of these haloes, and to quantify the way in which matter flows in and out of Eulerian cells. When the initial Lagrangian space distribution is white noise Gaussian, the model suggests that the Inverse Gaussian distribution should provide a reasonably good approximation to the evolved Eulerian density field, in agreement with numerical simulations. Application of this model to clustering from more general Gaussian initial conditions is discussed at the end.},

	abstract = {The {Press-Schechter,} excursion set approach allows one to make predictions about the shape and evolution of the mass function of bound objects. The approach combines the assumption that objects collapse spherically with the assumption that the initial density fluctuations were Gaussian and small. The predicted mass function is reasonably accurate, although it has fewer high-mass and more low-mass objects than are seen in simulations of hierarchical clustering. We show that the discrepancy between theory and simulation can be reduced substantially if bound structures are assumed to form from an ellipsoidal, rather than a spherical, collapse. In the original, standard, spherical model, a region collapses if the initial density within it exceeds a threshold value, deltasc. This value is independent of the initial size of the region, and since the mass of the collapsed object is related to its initial size, this means that deltasc is independent of final mass. In the ellipsoidal model, the collapse of a region depends on the surrounding shear field, as well as on its initial overdensity. In Gaussian random fields, the distribution of these quantities depends on the size of the region considered. Since the mass of a region is related to its initial size, there is a relation between the density threshold value required for collapse and the mass of the final object. We provide a fitting function to this deltaec(m) relation which simplifies the inclusion of ellipsoidal dynamics in the excursion set approach. We discuss the relation between the excursion set predictions and the halo distribution in high-resolution N-body simulations, and use our new formulation of the approach to show that our simple parametrization of the ellipsoidal collapse model represents an improvement on the spherical model on an object-by-object basis. Finally, we show that the associated statistical predictions, the mass function and the large-scale halo-to-mass bias relation, are also more accurate than the standard predictions.},

We present simple analytic approximations that allow us to compare the excursion set predictions associated with spherical and ellipsoidal collapse. In particular, we present formulae for the universal unconditional mass function of bound objects and the conditional mass function which describes the mass function of the progenitors of haloes in a given mass range today. We show that the ellipsoidal collapse based moving barrier model provides a better description of what we measure in the numerical simulations than the spherical collapse based constant barrier model, although the agreement between model and simulations is better at large lookback times. Our results for the conditional mass function can be used to compute accurate approximations to the local-density mass function, which quantifies the tendency for massive haloes to populate denser regions than less massive haloes. This happens because low-density regions can be thought of as being collapsed haloes viewed at large lookback times, whereas high-density regions are collapsed haloes viewed at small lookback times. Although we have applied our analytic formulae only to two simple barrier shapes, we show that they are, in fact, accurate for a wide variety of moving barriers.

When applying it to regions of a sample of 12 spiral galaxies at sub-kiloparsec resolution, the extended Schmidt law not only holds for {LSB} regions but also shows significantly smaller scatters both within and across galaxies compared with the {KS} law. We argue that this new relation points to the role of existing stars in regulating the {SFE}, thus better encoding the star formation physics. Comparison with physical models of star formation recipes shows that the extended Schmidt law can be reproduced by some models including gas free fall in a stellar-gravitational potential and pressure-supported star formation. By implementing this new law into the analytic model of gas accretion in {ΛCDM}, we show that it can reproduce the observed main sequence of star-forming galaxies (a relation between the {SFR} and stellar mass) from z = 0 up to z = 2.},

	abstract = {We present models of photometric evolution of galaxies in which the
effects of a dusty interstellar medium have been included with
particular care. A chemical evolution code follows the star formation
rate, the gas fraction, and the metallicity, basic ingredients for the
stellar population synthesis. The latter is performed with a grid of
integrated spectra of simple stellar populations {(SSP)} of different ages
and metallicities, in which the effects of dusty envelopes around
asymptotic giant branch {(AGB)} stars are included. The residual fraction
of gas in the galaxy is divided into two phases: the star-forming
molecular clouds and the diffuse medium. The relative amount is a model
parameter. The molecular gas is subdivided into clouds of given mass and
radius: it is supposed that each {SSP} is born within the cloud and
progressively escapes it. The emitted spectrum of the star-forming
molecular clouds is computed with a radiative transfer code. The diffuse
dust emission (cirrus) is derived by describing the galaxy as an axially
symmetric system, in which the local dust emissivity is consistently
calculated as a function of the local field intensity due to the stellar
component. Effects of very small grains, subject to temperature
fluctuations, as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons {(PAHs)} are
included. The model is compared and calibrated with available data of
normal and starburst galaxies in the local universe, in particular new
broadband and spectroscopic Infrared Space Observatory {(ISO)}
observations. It will be a powerful tool to investigate the star
formation, the initial mass function {(IMF),} supernova rate {(SNR)} in
nearby starbursts and normal galaxies, as well as to predict the
evolution of luminosity functions of different types of galaxies at
wavelengths covering four decades.},

	abstract = {We investigate the error properties of certain galaxy luminosity function ({GLF)} estimators. Using a cluster expansion of the density field, we show how, for both volume and flux limited samples, the {GLF} estimates are covariant. The covariance matrix can be decomposed into three pieces: a diagonal term arising from Poisson noise; a sample variance term arising from large-scale structure in the survey volume; an occupancy covariance term arising due to galaxies of different luminosities inhabiting the same cluster. To evaluate the theory one needs: the mass function and bias of clusters, and the conditional luminosity function ({CLF).} We use a semi-analytic model ({SAM)} galaxy catalogue from the Millennium run N-body simulation and the {CLF} of Yang et al. (2003) to explore these effects. The {GLF} estimates from the {SAM} and the {CLF} qualitatively reproduce results from the {2dFGRS.} We also measure the luminosity dependence of clustering in the {SAM} and find reasonable agreement with {2dFGRS} results for bright galaxies. However, for fainter galaxies, L0.5. Our theory is in good agreement with these measurements. These strong correlations can be attributed to sample variance. For a flux-limited survey of similar volume, the estimates are only slightly less correlated. We explore the importance of these effects for {GLF} model parameter estimation. We show that neglecting to take into account the bin-to-bin covariances can lead to significant systematic errors in best-fit parameters.},

	abstract = {We present a new semi-analytic model that self-consistently traces the growth of supermassive black holes {(BH)} and their host galaxies within the context of the Lambda cold dark matter {(LambdaCDM)} cosmological framework. In our model, the energy emitted by accreting black holes regulates the growth of the black holes themselves, drives galactic scale winds that can remove cold gas from galaxies, and produces powerful jets that heat the hot gas atmospheres surrounding groups and clusters. We present a comprehensive comparison of our model predictions with observational measurements of key physical properties of low-redshift galaxies, such as cold gas fractions, stellar metallicities and ages, and specific star formation rates. We find that our new models successfully reproduce the exponential cut-off in the stellar mass function and the stellar and cold gas mass densities at z {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 0, and predict that star formation should be largely, but not entirely, quenched in massive galaxies at the present day. We also find that our model of self-regulated {BH} growth naturally reproduces the observed relation between {BH} mass and bulge mass. We explore the global formation history of galaxies and black holes in our models, presenting predictions for the cosmic histories of star formation, stellar mass assembly, cold gas and metals. We find that models assuming the `concordance' {LambdaCDM} cosmology overproduce star formation and stellar mass at high redshift (z {\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textasciitilde 2). A model with less small-scale power predicts less star formation at high redshift, and excellent agreement with the observed stellar mass assembly history, but may have difficulty accounting for the cold gas in quasar absorption systems at high redshift (z {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 3-4).},

This measurement is made from observations of 2540 deg\{\textasciicircum\}2 of sky with arcminute resolution at 150 {GHz}, and improves upon previous measurements using the {SPT} by tripling the sky area. We report {CMB} temperature anisotropy power over the multipole range 650\{\textless\}\{\textbackslash\}ell\{\textless\}3000. We fit the {SPT} bandpowers, combined with the results from the seven-year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe {(WMAP7)} data release, with a six-parameter {LCDM} cosmological model and find that the two datasets are consistent and well fit by the model. Adding {SPT} measurements significantly improves {LCDM} parameter constraints, and in particular tightens the constraint on the angular sound horizon \{\textbackslash\}theta\_s by a factor of 2.7. The impact of gravitational lensing on the {CMB} power spectrum is detected with 8.1 \{\textbackslash\}sigma, the most significant detection to date. The inferred amplitude of the lensing spectrum is consistent with the {LCDM} prediction. This sensitivity of the {SPT+WMAP7} data to lensing by large-scale structure at low redshifts allows us to constrain the mean curvature of the observable universe with {CMB} data alone to be \{\textbackslash\}{Omega\_K=-0.003+0.014-0.018.} Using the {SPT+WMAP7} data, we measure the spectral index of scalar fluctuations to be ns=0.9623+/-0.0097 in the {LCDM} model, a 3.9 \{\textbackslash\}sigma preference for a scale-dependent spectrum with ns\{\textless\}1. The {SPT} measurement of the {CMB} damping tail helps break the degeneracy that exists between the tensor-to-scalar ratio r and ns in large-scale {CMB} measurements, leading to an upper limit of r\{\textless\}0.18 (95\% {C.L.)} in the {LCDM+r} model.

The mean convergence measured in the source plane is found to be systematically negative, rather than zero as often assumed, and is correlated with the convergence variance.

evolution and its effects on galactic and globular cluster evolution. We
show that parameters such as the density and the metallicity of the
environment significantly influence the evolution of the remnant and
thus change its effects on the global environment (e.g., globular
clusters, galaxies) as a source of thermal and kinetic energy. We
conducted our studies using a one-dimensional hydrodynamics code, in
which we implemented a metallicity-dependent cooling function. Global
time-dependent quantities such as the total kinetic and thermal energies
and the radial extent are calculated for a grid of parameter sets. The
quantities calculated are the total energy, the kinetic energy, the
thermal energy, the radial extent, and the mass. We distinguished
between the hot, rarefied bubble and the cold, dense shell, since these
two phases are distinct in their roles in a gas-stellar system. We also
present power-law fits to those quantities as a function of
environmental parameters after the extensive cooling has ceased. The
power-law fits enable simple incorporation of improved supernova energy
input and matter redistribution (including the effect of the local
conditions) in galactic/globular cluster models. Our results for the
energetics of supernova remnants in the late stages of their expansion
give total energies ranging from {\textasciitilde}9 x 1049 to {\textasciitilde}3 x 1050 ergs, with a
typical case being {\textasciitilde}1050 ergs, depending on the surrounding environment.
About 8.5 x 1049 ergs of this energy can be found in the form of kinetic
energy. Supernovae play an important role in the evolution of the
interstellar medium and galaxies as a whole, providing mechanisms for
kinetic energy input and for phase transitions of the interstellar
medium. However, we have found that the total energy input per supernova
is about 1 order of magnitude smaller than the initial explosion energy.},

be used for different cosmologies and redshifts when expressed in

finding is that the mass function cannot be represented by a universal

The average circularity of the orbits is epsilon{\textasciitilde}=0.5, while either radial or almost circular orbits are equally avoided. More massive satellites move along slightly more eccentric orbits, with lower specific angular momentum and a smaller pericentre. We find that the infall of satellites on to the main cluster progenitor has a very anisotropic distribution. This anisotropy is to a large extent responsible for the shape and orientation of the final cluster and of its velocity ellipsoid. At the end of the simulations, the major axis of the cluster is aligned both with that of its velocity ellipsoid and with the major axis of the ellipsoid defined by the satellite infall pattern, to {\textasciitilde}30 deg on average. We also find that, in lower mass clusters, a higher fraction of the final virial mass is provided by small, dense satellites.

	volume = {546},
	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001ApJ...546...63T},
	abstract = {The thermodynamics of the diffuse, X-ray-emitting gas in clusters of
galaxies is determined by gravitational processes associated with
infalling gas, shock heating and adiabatic compression, and
nongravitational processes such as heating by supernovae, stellar winds,
activity in central galactic nuclei, and radiative cooling. The effect
of gravitational processes on the thermodynamics of the intracluster
medium {(ICM)} can be expressed in terms of the {ICM} entropy. The entropy
is a convenient variable as long as cooling is negligible, since it
remains constant during the phase of adiabatic compression during
accretion into the potential well, and it shows a single steplike
increase during shock heating. Observations indicate that
nongravitational processes also play a key role in determining the
distribution of entropy in the {ICM.} In particular, an entropy excess
with respect to that produced by purely gravitational processes has been
recently detected in the centers of low-temperature systems. This type
of entropy excess is believed to be responsible for many other
properties of local X-ray clusters, including the {L-T} relation and the
flat density cores in clusters and groups. In this paper we assume that
the entropy excess is present in the intergalactic medium {(IGM)} baryons
before the gas is accreted by the dark matter halos and reaches high
densities. We use a generalized spherical model to compute the X-ray
properties of groups and clusters for a range of initial entropy levels
in the {IGM} and for a range of mass scales, cosmic epochs, and background
cosmologies. In particular, we follow the formation of adiabatic cores
during the first stages of the gravitational collapse and the subsequent
evolution of the central entropy due to radiative energy loss. The model
predicts the statistical properties of the cluster population at a given
epoch and also allows study of the evolution of single X-ray halos as a
function of their age. We find that the statistical properties of the
X-ray clusters strongly depend on the value of the initial background
entropy. Assuming a constant, uniform value for the background entropy,
the present-day X-ray data are well fitted for the following range of
values of the adiabatic constant:
{K*≡kBT/μmpρ2/3=(0.4+/-0.1)×1034} ergs cm2
g-5/3 for clusters with average temperatures {kT{\textgreater}2} {keV} and
K*=(0.2+/-0.1)×1034 ergs cm2
g-5/3 for groups and clusters with average temperatures
{kBT{\textless}2} {keV.} These values correspond to different excess
energy per particle of
{kBT{\textgreater}=0.1(K*/0.4×1034)} {keV.} The
dependence of K* on the mass scale can be well reproduced by
an epoch-dependent external entropy: the relation
K*=0.8(1+z)-1×1034 ergs
cm2 g-5/3 fits the data over the whole temperature
range. The model can be extended to include internal heating, but in
this case the energy budget required to fit the X-ray properties would
be much higher. Observations of both local and distant clusters can be
used to trace the distribution and the evolution of the entropy in the
cosmic baryons and to constrain the typical epoch and the source of the
heating processes. The X-ray satellites Chandra and {XMM} can add to our
knowledge of the history of the cosmic baryons, already derived from the
high-redshift, low-density gas observed in the {QSO} absorption-line
clouds, by imaging the hot, higher density plasma observed in groups and
clusters of galaxies.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2005MNRAS.359.1029V},
	abstract = {We present a simple, semi-analytical model to compute the mass functions of dark matter subhaloes. The masses of subhaloes at their time of accretion are obtained from a standard merger tree. During the subsequent evolution, the subhaloes experience mass loss due to the combined effect of dynamical friction, tidal stripping, and tidal heating. Rather than integrating these effects along individual subhalo orbits, we consider the average mass-loss rate, where the average is taken over all possible orbital configurations. Under the Ansatz that the average distribution of orbits is independent of parent halo mass, this allows us to write the average mass-loss rate as a simple function that depends only on redshift and on the instantaneous mass ratio of subhalo and parent halo. After calibrating this model by matching the subhalo mass function {(SHMF)} of cluster-sized dark matter haloes obtained from high-resolution, numerical simulations, we investigate the predicted mass and redshift dependence of the {SHMF.} We find that, contrary to previous claims, the subhalo mass function is not universal. Instead, both the slope and the normalization depend on the ratio of the parent halo mass, M, and the characteristic non-linear mass M*. This simply reflects a halo formation time dependence; more massive parent haloes form later, thus allowing less time for mass loss to operate. We predict that galaxy-sized haloes, with a present-day mass of M{\textasciitilde}= {1012h-1Msolar,} have an average mass fraction of dark matter subhaloes that is a factor of 3 lower than for massive clusters with M{\textasciitilde}= {1015h-1Msolar.} We also analyse the halo-to-halo scatter in {SHMFs,} and show that the subhalo mass fraction of individual haloes depends most strongly on their accretion history in the last {{\textasciitilde}1Gyr.} Finally we provide a simple fitting function for the average {SHMF} of a parent halo of any mass at any redshift and for any cosmology, and briefly discuss several implications of our findings.},

This is important to resolve because it is only the out-of-plane kicks that can reach more than 500 km/s and can thus eject merged remnants from galaxies. Using a different ansatz for the out-of-plane kick, we show that we can fit almost all existing data to better than 5 \%. This is good enough for any astrophysical calculation, and shows that the previous apparent conflict was only because the two data sets explored different aspects of the kick parameter space.},

	abstract = {We assess models for the assembly of supermassive black holes {(SMBHs)} at the center of galaxies that trace their hierarchical buildup far up in the dark halo ``merger tree.'' Motivated by the recent discovery of luminous quasars around redshift z{\textasciitilde}6-suggesting a very early assembly epoch-and by numerical simulations of the fragmentation of primordial molecular clouds in cold dark matter {(CDM)} cosmogonies, we assume that the first ``seed'' black holes {(BHs)} had intermediate masses and formed in (mini)halos collapsing at z{\textasciitilde}20 from high-σ density fluctuations. As these pregalactic holes become incorporated through a series of mergers into larger and larger halos, they sink to the center because of dynamical friction, accrete a fraction of the gas in the merger remnant to become supermassive, form a binary system, and eventually coalesce. The merger history of dark matter halos and associated {BHs} is followed by cosmological Monte Carlo realizations of the merger hierarchy from early times until the present in a {ΛCDM} cosmology. A simple model, where quasar activity is driven by major mergers and {SMBHs} accrete at the Eddington rate a mass that scales with the fifth power of the circular velocity of the host halo, is shown to reproduce the observed luminosity function of optically selected quasars in the redshift range 1{\textless}5. A scheme for describing the hardening of a {BH} binary in a stellar background with core formation due to mass ejection is applied, where the stellar cusp proportional to r-2 is promptly regenerated after every major merger event, replenishing the mass displaced by the binary. Triple {BH} interactions will inevitably take place at early times if the formation route for the assembly of {SMBHs} goes back to the very first generation of stars, and we follow them in our merger tree. The assumptions underlying our scenario lead to the prediction of a population of massive {BHs} wandering in galaxy halos and the intergalactic medium at the present epoch and contributing {\textless}{\textasciitilde}10\% to the total {BH} mass density, {ρSMBH=4×105} Msolar Mpc-3 (h=0.7). The fraction of binary {SMBHs} in galaxy nuclei is on the order of 10\% today, and it increases with redshift so that almost all massive nuclear {BHs} at early epochs are in binary systems. The fraction of binary quasars (both members brighter than {0.1L*)} instead is less than 0.3\% at all epochs. The nuclear {SMBH} occupation fraction is unity (0.6) at the present epoch if the first seed {BHs} were as numerous as the 3.5 σ (4 σ) density peaks at z=20.},

	abstract = {We present a new systematic way of setting up galactic gas disks based on the assumption of detailed hydrodynamic equilibrium. To do this, we need to specify the density distribution and the velocity field which supports the disk. We first show that the required circular velocity has no dependence on the height above or below the midplane so long as the gas pressure is a function of density only. The assumption of disks being very thin enables us to decouple the vertical structure from the radial direction. Based on that, the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium together with the reduced Poisson equation leads to two sets of second-order non-linear differential equation, which are easily integrated to set-up a stable disk. We call one approach `density method' and the other one `potential method'. Gas disks in detailed balance are especially suitable for investigating the onset of the gravitational instability. We revisit the question of global, axisymmetric instability using fully three-dimensional disk simulations. The impact of disk thickness on the disk instability and the formation of spontaneously induced spirals is studied systematically with or without the presence of the stellar potential. In our models, the numerical results show that the threshold value for disk instability is shifted from unity to 0.69 for self-gravitating thick disks and to 0.75 for combined stellar and gas thick disks. The simulations also show that self-induced spirals occur in the correct regions and with the right numbers as predicted by the analytic theory.},

	abstract = {We study the relation between the density profiles of dark matter halos
and their mass assembly histories using a statistical sample of halos in
a high-resolution N-body simulation of the {ΛCDM} cosmology. For
each halo at z=0, we identify its merger history tree and determine
concentration parameters cvir for all progenitors, thus
providing a structural merger tree for each halo. We fit the mass
accretion histories by a universal function with one parameter, the
formation epoch ac, defined when the log mass accretion rate
{dlogM/dloga} falls below a critical value S. We find that late-forming
galaxies tend to be less concentrated, such that cvir
``observed'' at any epoch ao is strongly correlated with
ac via
cvir=c1ao/ac. Scatter about
this relation is mostly due to measurement errors in cvir and
ac, implying that the actual spread in cvir for
halos of a given mass can be mostly attributed to scatter in
ac. We demonstrate that this relation can also be used to
predict the mass and redshift dependence of cvir and the
scatter about the median {cvir(M,z)} using accretion histories
derived from the extended {Press-Schechter} {(EPS)} formalism, after
adjusting for a constant offset between the formation times as predicted
by {EPS} and as measured in the simulations; this new ingredient can thus
be easily incorporated into semianalytic models of galaxy formation. The
correlation found between halo concentration and mass accretion rate
suggests a physical interpretation: for high mass infall rates, the
central density is related to the background density; when the mass
infall rate slows, the central density stays approximately constant, and
the halo concentration just grows as Rvir. Because of the
direct connection between halo concentration and velocity rotation
curves and because of probable connections between halo mass assembly
history and star formation history, the tight correlation between these
properties provides an essential new ingredient for galaxy formation
modeling.},

	abstract = {We examine the prospect of using the observed abundance of weak gravitational lenses to constrain the equation-of-state parameter w=p/ρ of dark energy. Dark energy modifies the distance-redshift relation, the amplitude of the matter power spectrum, and the rate of structure growth. As a result, it affects the efficiency with which dark-matter concentrations produce detectable weak-lensing signals. Here we solve the spherical-collapse model with dark energy, clarifying some ambiguities found in the literature. We also provide fitting formulae for the non-linear overdensity at virialization and the linear-theory overdensity at collapse. We then compute the variation in the predicted weak-lens abundance with w. We find that the predicted redshift distribution and number count of weak lenses are highly degenerate in w and the present matter density Ω0. If we fix Ω0 the number count of weak lenses for w=-2/3 is a factor of {\textasciitilde}2 smaller than for the Λ cold dark matter ({CDM)} model w=-1. However, if we allow Ω0 to vary with w such that the amplitude of the matter power spectrum as measured by the Cosmic Background Explorer ({COBE)} matches that obtained from the X-ray cluster abundance, the decrease in the predicted lens abundance is less than 25 per cent for -1 {\textless}=w{\textless} -0.4. We show that a more promising method for constraining dark energy - one that is largely unaffected by the Ω0-w degeneracy as well as uncertainties in observational noise - is to compare the relative abundance of virialized X-ray lensing clusters with the abundance of non-virialized, X-ray underluminous, lensing haloes. For aperture sizes of {\textasciitilde}15 arcmin, the predicted ratio of the non-virialized to virialized lenses is greater than 40 per cent and varies by {\textasciitilde}20 per cent between w=-1 and -0.6. Overall, we find that, if all other weak-lensing parameters are fixed, a survey must cover at least {\textasciitilde}40 deg2 in order for the weak-lens number count to differentiate a {ΛCDM} cosmology from a dark-energy model with w=-0.9 at the 3σ level. If, on the other hand, we take into account uncertainties in the lensing parameters, then the non-virialized lens fraction provides the most robust constraint on w, requiring {\textasciitilde}50 deg2 of sky coverage in order to differentiate a {ΛCDM} model from a w=-0.6 model to 3σ.},

The techniques presented are based on experience gained in modelling star-counts and stellar populations, analysing the morphology of galaxy images, and performing Bayesian investigations of semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. These inference problems require advanced Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC)} algorithms that expedite sampling, mixing, and the analysis of the Bayesian posterior distribution. The {BIE} was designed to be a collaborative platform for applying Bayesian methodology to astronomy. By providing a variety of statistical algorithms for all phases of the inference problem, a user may explore a variety of approaches with a single model implementation. Indeed, each of the separate scientific investigations above has benefited from the solutions posed for the other investigations, and I anticipate that the same solutions will be of general value for other areas of astronomical research. Finally, to protect one's computational investment against loss any equipment failure and human error, the {BIE} includes a comprehensive persistence system that enables byte-level checkpointing and restoration.},

	abstract = {Using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey Data Release 2, we investigate the correlation between
various galaxy properties and halo mass. We split the population of
galaxies in early-types, late-types and intermediate-types, based on
their colour and specific star formation rate. At fixed luminosity, the
late- (early-)type fraction of galaxies increases (decreases) with
decreasing halo mass. Most importantly, this mass dependence is smooth
and persists over the entire mass range probed, without any break or
feature at any mass-scale. We argue that the previous claim of a
characteristic feature on galaxy group scales is an artefact of the
environment estimators used. At fixed halo mass, the luminosity
dependence of the type fractions is surprisingly weak, especially over
the range 0.25 {{\textless}{\textasciitilde}L/L*{\textless}{\textasciitilde}} 2.5: galaxy type depends more strongly on
halo mass than on luminosity. In agreement with previous studies, the
late- (early-)type fraction increases (decreases) with increasing
halocentric radius. However, we find that this radial dependence is
present in haloes of all masses probed (down to
{1012h-1Msolar),} while previous studies
did not find any radial dependence in haloes with M{\textless}{\textasciitilde}
{1013.5h-1Msolar.} We argue that this
discrepancy owes to the fact that we have excluded central galaxies from
our analysis. We also find that the properties of satellite galaxies are
strongly correlated with those of their central galaxy. In particular,
the early-type fraction of satellites is significantly higher in a halo
with an early-type central galaxy than in a halo of the same mass but
with a late-type central galaxy. This phenomenon, which we call
`galactic conformity', is present in haloes of all masses and for
satellites of all luminosities. Finally, the fraction of
intermediate-type galaxies is always {\textasciitilde}20 per cent, independent of
luminosity, independent of halo mass, independent of halocentric radius,
and independent of whether the galaxy is a central galaxy or a satellite
galaxy. We discuss the implications of all these findings for galaxy

Many galaxy evolution models assume that satellite galaxies eventually merge with their central galaxy, but this ignores the possibility of satellite tidal disruption. We use a high-resolution N-body simulation of cosmological volume to explore satellite galaxy merging/disruption criteria based on dark matter subhalo dynamics. We explore the impact that satellite merging/disruption has on the halo occupation distribution and radial profile of the remnants. Using abundance matching to assign stellar mass/luminosity to subhaloes, we compare with observed galaxy clustering, satellite fractions, cluster satellite luminosity functions, finding that subhaloes reproduce well these observables. Our results imply that satellite subhaloes corresponding to {{\textgreater}0.2L*} galaxies must be well resolved down to 1-3 per cent of their mass at infall to robustly trace the galaxy population.

The model accounts for the large amount of nongaseous 'dark matter', apparently making up about 80\% or more of the virial mass in clusters such as Coma and which may constitute massive halos around large galaxies. At work is a process of self-similar gravitational clustering in an expanding universe. The clustering builds up in hierarchical fashion; the smaller-scale virialized systems merge into an amorphous whole when they are incorporated in a larger bound cluster. Residual gas in the resulting potential wells cools and acquires sufficient concentration to self-gravitate, forming luminous galaxies up to a limiting size. This limit agrees adequately with the masses, luminosities, and radii of large galaxies.

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.386.1023W},
	abstract = {The major theoretical limitation for extracting cosmological parameters
from the cosmic microwave background {(CMB)} sky lies in the precision
with which we can calculate the cosmological recombination process.
Uncertainty in the details of hydrogen and helium recombination could
effectively increase the errors or bias the values of the cosmological
parameters derived from the Planck satellite, for example. Here, we
modify the cosmological recombination code {RECFAST} by introducing one
more parameter to reproduce the recent numerical results for the
speed-up of the helium recombination. Together with the existing
hydrogen fudge factor, we vary these two parameters to account for the
remaining dominant uncertainties in cosmological recombination. By using
the {COSMOMC} code with Planck forecast data, we find that we need to
determine the parameters to better than 10 per cent for {HeI} and 1 per
cent for H, in order to obtain negligible effects on the cosmological
parameters. For helium recombination, if the existing studies have
calculated the ionization fraction to the 0.1 per cent level by properly
including the relevant physical processes, then we already have
numerical calculations which are accurate enough for Planck. For
hydrogen, setting the fudge factor to speed up low-redshift
recombination by 14 per cent appears to be sufficient for Planck.
However, more work still needs to be done to carry out comprehensive
numerical calculations of all the relevant effects for hydrogen, as well
as to check for effects which couple hydrogen and helium recombination
through the radiation field.},

	abstract = {We compare two techniques for following the cooling of gas and its condensation into galaxies within high-resolution simulations of cosmologically representative regions. Both techniques treat the dark matter using N-body methods. One follows the gas using smoothed particle hydrodynamics {(SPH)} while the other uses simplified recipes from semi-analytic {(SA)} models. We compare the masses and locations predicted for dense knots of cold gas (the `galaxies') when the two techniques are applied to evolution from the same initial conditions and when the additional complications of star formation and feedback are ignored. We find that above the effective resolution limit of the two techniques, they give very similar results both for global quantities such as the total amount of cooled gas and for the properties of individual `galaxies'. The {SA} technique has systematic uncertainties arising from the simplified cooling model adopted, while details of the {SPH} implementation can produce substantial systematic variations in the galaxy masses it predicts. Nevertheless, for the best current {SPH} methods and the standard assumptions of the {SA} model, systematic differences between the two techniques are remarkably small. The {SA} technique gives adequate predictions for the condensation of gas into `galaxies' at less than one per cent of the computational cost of obtaining similar results at comparable resolution using {SPH.}},

Such a distribution is shown to satisfy an integral equation that can be solved by a simple matrix inversion, without the need for Monte Carlo simulations, making this useful for exploring a large parameter space. We discuss examples in which common analytic approximations fail, a failure that can be remedied using the method described here.},

	volume = {707},
	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...707..354Z},
	abstract = {A large amount of observations have constrained cosmological parameters
and the initial density fluctuation spectrum to a very high accuracy.
However, cosmological parameters change with time and the power index of
the power spectrum dramatically varies with mass scale in the so-called
concordance {ΛCDM} cosmology. Thus, any successful model for its
structural evolution should work well simultaneously for various
cosmological models and different power spectra. We use a large set of
high-resolution N-body simulations of a variety of structure formation
models (scale-free, standard {CDM,} open {CDM,} and {ΛCDM)} to study
the mass accretion histories, the mass and redshift dependence of
concentrations, and the concentration evolution histories of dark matter
halos. We find that there is significant disagreement between the
much-used empirical models in the literature and our simulations. Based
on our simulation results, we find that the mass accretion rate of a
halo is tightly correlated with a simple function of its mass, the
redshift, parameters of the cosmology, and of the initial density
fluctuation spectrum, which correctly disentangles the effects of all
these factors and halo environments. We also find that the concentration
of a halo is strongly correlated with the universe age when its
progenitor on the mass accretion history first reaches 4\% of its current
mass. According to these correlations, we develop new empirical models
for both the mass accretion histories and the concentration evolution
histories of dark matter halos, and the latter can also be used to
predict the mass and redshift dependence of halo concentrations. These
models are accurate and universal: the same set of model parameters
works well for different cosmological models and for halos of different
masses at different redshifts, and in the {ΛCDM} case the model
predictions match the simulation results very well even though halo mass
is traced to about 0.0005 times the final mass, when cosmological
parameters and the power index of the initial density fluctuation
spectrum have changed dramatically. Our model predictions also match the
{PINOCCHIO} mass accretion histories very well, which are much independent
of our numerical simulations and our definitions of halo merger trees.
These models are also simple and easy to implement, making them very
useful in modeling the growth and structure of dark matter halos. We
provide appendices describing the step-by-step implementation of our
models. A calculator which allows one to interactively generate data for
any given cosmological model is provided on the Web, together with a
user-friendly code to make the relevant calculations and some tables
listing the expected concentration as a function of halo mass and
redshift in several popular cosmological models. We explain why
{ΛCDM} and open {CDM} halos on nearly all mass scales show two
distinct phases in their mass growth histories. We discuss implications
of the universal relations we find in connection to the formation of
dark matter halos in the cosmic density field.},

merger simulations using {FLASH.} These are the highest-resolution
simulations to date of such mergers using an {AMR} grid-based code with
Eulerian hydrodynamics. In this first paper in a series we investigate
the effects of merging on the entropy of the hot intracluster gas,
specifically with regard to the ability of merging to heat and disrupt
cluster "cool-cores." We find, in line with recent works, that the
effect of fluid instabilities that are well-resolved in grid-based codes
is to significantly mix the gases of the two clusters and to
significantly increase the entropy of the gas of the final merger
remnant. This result is characteristic of mergers over a range of
initial mass ratio and impact parameter. In line with this, we find that
the kinetic energy associated with random motions is higher in our
merger remnants which have high entropy floors, indicating the motions
have efficiently mixed the gas and heated the cluster core with gas of
initially high entropy. We examine the implications of this result for
the maintenance of high entropy floors in the centers of galaxy clusters
and the derivation of the properties of dark matter from the thermal
properties of the X-ray emitting gas.},

ranging from α{\textasciitilde}-1.2 in the lowest density environments to
α{\textasciitilde}-1.5 in the highest density environments probed by this blind {HI}
