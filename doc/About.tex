\chapter{About Galacticus}

\glc\ is a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. It solves equations describing how galaxies evolve in a merging hierarchy of dark matter halos in a cold dark matter universe. \glc\ has much in common with other semi-analytic models, such as the range of physical processes included and the type of quantities that it can predict.

In designing \glc\ our main goal was to make the code flexible, modular and easily extensible. Much greater priority was placed on making the code easy to use and modify than on making it fast. We believe that a modular and extensible nature is crucial as galaxy formation is an evolving science. In particular, key design features are:
\begin{description}
 \item [Extensible methods for all functions:] Essentially all functions within \glc\ are designed to be extensible, meaning that you can write your own version and insert it into \glc\ easily. For example, suppose you want to use an improved functional form for the \gls{cdm} halo mass function. You would simply write a subroutine conforming to a specified template that computes this mass function and add a short directive (see \S\ref{sec:CodeDirectives}) in your code which explains to the build system how to insert this function in \glc. A recompile of the code will then incorporate your new function.

 \item [Extensible components for tree nodes:] The basic structure in \glc\ is a merger tree, which consists of a linked tree of nodes which have various properties. \glc\ works by evolving the nodes forwards in time subject to a collection of differential equations and other rules. Each node can contains an arbitrary number of \emph{components}. A component may be a dark matter halo, a galactic disk, a black hole etc. Each component may have an arbitrary number of \emph{properties} (some of which may be evolving, others of which can be fixed). \glc\ makes it easy to add additional components. For example, suppose you wanted to add a ``stellar halo'' components (consisting of stars stripped from satellite galaxies). To do this, you would write a module which specifies the following for this component:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Number of properties;
  \item Interfaces to set and get property values and rates of change;
  \item ``Pipes'' which allow for flows of mass/energy/etc. from one component to another;
  \item Functions describing the differential equations which govern the evolution of the properties;
  \item Functions describing how the component responds to various events (e.g. the node becoming a satellite, a galaxy-galaxy merger, etc.);
  \item Auxiliary functions for handling outputs etc.
 \end{itemize}
 Short directives embedded in this module explain to the \glc\ build system how to incorporate the new component. A recompile will then build your new component into \glc. Typically, a new component can be created quickly by copying an existing one and modifying it as necessary. Furthermore, multiple implementations of a component are allowed. For example, \glc\ contains a component which is a Hernquist spheroid. You could add a de Vaucouler's spheroid component. A simple input parameter then allows you to select which implementation will be used in a given run.

 \item [Centralized ODE solver:] \glc\ evolves nodes in merger trees by calling an ODE solver which integrates forwards in time to solve for the evolution of the properties of each component in a node. This means that you do not need to provide explicit solutions for ODEs (in many cases such solutions are not available anyway) and timestepping is automatically handled to achieve a specified level of precision. The ODE solver allows for the evolution to be interrupted. A component may trigger an interrupt at any time and may do so for a number of reasons. A typical use is to actually create a component within a given node---for example when gas first begins to cool and inflow in a node the disk component must be created. Other uses include interrupting evolution when a merging event occurs.
