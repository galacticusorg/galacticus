\section{Merger Tree Builder}\label{sec:MergerTreeBuilder}\index{merger trees!building}

\glc\ contains software which builds merger tree files in the format described in \S\ref{sec:MergerTreeFormatDescription} from merger tree descriptions in other formats, such as ASCII output from an SQL database. The merger tree building engine can be found in \hyperlink{objects.merger_tree_data.F90}{{\normalfont \ttfamily source/objects.merger\_tree\_data.F90}}. Examples of how this engine is used can be found in \hyperlink{Millennium_Merger_Tree_File_Maker.F90}{{\normalfont \ttfamily source/Millennium\_Merger\_Tree\_File\_Maker.F90}} and \hyperlink{merger_trees.file_maker.Millennium.F90}{{\normalfont \ttfamily source/merger\_trees.file\_maker.Millennium.F90}} which are designed to work with the {\normalfont \ttfamily scripts/aux/Millennium\_Trees\_Grab.pl} script to convert data extracted from the \href{http://www.g-vo.org/MyMillennium3/}{Millennium Simulation database} into a format that \glc\ can read, and in \hyperlink{Simple_Merger_Tree_File_Maker.F90}{{\normalfont \ttfamily source/Simple\_Merger\_Tree\_File\_Maker.F90}} and \hyperlink{merger_trees.file_maker.simple.F90}{{\normalfont \ttfamily source/merger\_trees.file\_maker.simple.F90}} which are designed to work with ASCII file representations of mergers trees that contain just the mass, redshift and descendent of each node.

The basic process for building a merger tree file is to inform the engine of the data file to read and where specific information is located within that file. The data can then be processed and, finally, output in the required format. Specific interfaces that can be used are described below. Many of these interfaces work on an object {\normalfont \ttfamily mergerTrees} of {\normalfont \ttfamily mergerTreeData} type. This object stores all information on the merger trees while they are being internally processed.

\noindent \emph{Setting property locations:} Before reading data from a file it is necessary to inform the tree builder engine of which column in the file corresponds to which property. This is done with repeated calls to {\normalfont \ttfamily setProperty}, one for each column to read, as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
call mergerTrees%setProperty(propertyType,columnIndex)
\end{verbatim}
where {\normalfont \ttfamily columnIndex} is the number of the column (counting from 1) which contains the property specified by {\normalfont \ttfamily propertyType}. {\normalfont \ttfamily propertyType} can take one of the following values:
\begin{description}
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeTreeIndex}] A unique ID number for the tree to which this node belongs;
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeNodeIndex}] An ID (unique within the tree) for this node;
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeDescendentIndex}] The ID of the node's descendent node;
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeHostIndex}] The ID of the larger halo in which this node is hosted (equal to the node's own ID if the node is self-hosting);
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeRedshift}] The redshift of the node;
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeNodeMass}] The mass of the node;
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeParticleCount}] The number of particles in the node;
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypePositionX}] The $x$-position of the node (if present, both $y$ and $z$ components must also be present);
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypePositionY}] The $y$-position of the node (if present, both $x$ and $z$ components must also be present);
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypePositionZ}] The $z$-position of the node (if present, both $x$ and $y$ components must also be present);
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeVelocityX}] The $x$-velocity of the node (if present, both $y$ and $z$ components must also be present);
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeVelocityY}] The $y$-velocity of the node (if present, both $x$ and $z$ components must also be present);
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeVelocityZ}] The $z$-velocity of the node (if present, both $x$ and $y$ components must also be present);
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeSpinX}] The $x$ component of the node's spin parameter (if present, both $y$ and $z$ components must also be present; cannot be present if spin magnitude is given);
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeSpinY}] The $y$ component of the node's spin parameter (if present, both $x$ and $z$ components must also be present; cannot be present if spin magnitude is given);
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeSpinZ}] The $z$ component of the node's spin parameter (if present, both $x$ and $y$ components must also be present; cannot be present if spin magnitude is given);
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeSpin}] The magnitude of the node's spin parameter (cannot be present if spin vector components are given);          
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeAngularMomentumX}] The $x$-component of the node's angular momentum (if present, both $y$ and $z$ components must also be present; cannot be present if angular momentum magnitude is given);
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeAngularMomentumY}] The $y$-component of the node's angular momentum (if present, both $x$ and $z$ components must also be present; cannot be present if angular momentum magnitude is given);
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeAngularMomentumZ}] The $z$-component of the node's angular momentum (if present, both $x$ and $y$ components must also be present; cannot be present if angular momentum magnitude is given);
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeAngularMomentum}] The magnitude of the node's angular momentum (cannot be present if angular momentum vector components are given);
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeHalfMassRadius}] The half-mass radius of the node;
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeMostBoundParticleIndex}] The index of the most bound particle in this node.
\end{description}
Not all properties must be specified---any required properties that are not specified will result in an error. Likewise, some properties, if present, require that other properties also be present. For example, if any of the position properties is given then all three positions are required.\\

\noindent \emph{Reading ASCII data:} Once property columns have been specified, data from an ASCII file with one node per line can be read as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
call mergerTrees%readASCII(nodesFile,lineNumberStart,lineNumberStop,separator=",")
\end{verbatim}
where {\normalfont \ttfamily nodesFile} is the name of the file to read. The optional {\normalfont \ttfamily lineNumberStart} and {\normalfont \ttfamily lineNumberEnd} arguments give the first and last lines of the file to read, while the optional {\normalfont \ttfamily separator} argument specifies the character used to separate columns (white space is assumed by default).\\

\noindent \emph{Setting particle property locations:} If particle information is to be stored in the file, the locations of particle properties within the input file must be specified with repeated calls to {\normalfont \ttfamily setParticleProperty} as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
call mergerTrees%setParticleProperty(propertyType,columnIndex)
\end{verbatim}
where {\normalfont \ttfamily columnIndex} is the number of the column (counting from 1) which contains the property specified by {\normalfont \ttfamily propertyType}. {\normalfont \ttfamily propertyType} can take one of the following values:
\begin{description}
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeParticleIndex}] A unique ID for the particle;
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeRedshift}] The redshift of the particle;
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeNodeMass}] The mass of the particle;
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeParticleCount}] The number of particles in the particle;
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypePositionX}] The $x$-position of the particle (if present, both $y$ and $z$ components must also be present);
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypePositionY}] The $y$-position of the particle (if present, both $x$ and $z$ components must also be present);
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypePositionZ}] The $z$-position of the particle (if present, both $x$ and $y$ components must also be present);
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeVelocityX}] The $x$-velocity of the particle (if present, both $y$ and $z$ components must also be present);
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeVelocityY}] The $y$-velocity of the particle (if present, both $x$ and $z$ components must also be present);
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily propertyTypeVelocityZ}] The $z$-velocity of the particle (if present, both $x$ and $y$ components must also be present).
\end{description}

\noindent \emph{Reading ASCII particle data:} Once property columns have been specified, particle data from an ASCII file with one particle per line can be read as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
call mergerTrees%readParticlesASCII(particlesFile,lineNumberStart,lineNumberStop,separator=",")
\end{verbatim}
where {\normalfont \ttfamily particlesFile} is the name of the file to read. The optional {\normalfont \ttfamily lineNumberStart} and {\normalfont \ttfamily lineNumberEnd} arguments give the first and last lines of the file to read, while the optional {\normalfont \ttfamily separator} argument specifies the character used to separate columns (white space is assumed by default).\\

\noindent \emph{Setting particle mass:} The particle mass, {\normalfont \ttfamily particleMass}, can be specified using:
\begin{verbatim}
call mergerTrees%setParticleMass(particleMass)
\end{verbatim}

\noindent \emph{Specifying tree self-containment:} Whether or not trees are self-contained can be specified using:
\begin{verbatim}
call mergerTrees%setSelfContained([.true.|.false.])
\end{verbatim}

\noindent \emph{Specifying Hubble flow inclusion:} Whether or not velocities include the Hubble flow can be speified using:
\begin{verbatim}
call mergerTrees%setIncludesHubbleFlow([.true.|.false.])
\end{verbatim}

\noindent \emph{Specifying subhalo mass inclusion:} Whether or not halo masses include the masses of any subhalos can be specified using:
\begin{verbatim}
call mergerTrees%setIncludesSubhaloMasses([.true.|.false.])
\end{verbatim}

\noindent \emph{Specifying reference creation:} Whether or not HDF5 reference to individual merger trees within the {\normalfont \ttfamily haloTrees} datasets should be made can be specified using:
\begin{verbatim}
call mergerTrees%makeReferences([.true.|.false.])
\end{verbatim}

\noindent \emph{Specifying units:} The units used in the files can be specified with repeated calls to {\normalfont \ttfamily setUnits} as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
call mergerTrees%setUnits(unitsType,unitsInSI,hubbleExponent,scaleFactorExponent)
\end{verbatim}
where {\normalfont \ttfamily unitsType} is one of:
\begin{description}
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily unitsMass}] Units of mass;
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily unitsLength}] Units of length;
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily unitsTime}] Units of time;
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily unitsVelocity}] Units of velocity;
\end{description}
{\normalfont \ttfamily unitsInSI} gives the units in the SI system, {\normalfont \ttfamily hubbleExponent} specifies the power to which $h$ appears in the units and {\normalfont \ttfamily scaleFactorExponent} specifies the number of powers of the expansion factor by which the quantity should be multiplied to place it into physical units.\\

\noindent \emph{Adding metadata:} Meta-data can be added to the file by making repeated calls to {\normalfont \ttfamily addMetadata} as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
call mergerTrees%addMetadata(metaDataType,label,value)
\end{verbatim}
where {\normalfont \ttfamily metaDataType} is one of:
\begin{description}
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily metaDataGeneric}] Add to the generic {\normalfont \ttfamily metaData} group;
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily metaDataCosmology}] Add to the {\normalfont \ttfamily cosmology} group;
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily metaDataSimulation}] Add to the {\normalfont \ttfamily simulation} group;

 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily metaDataTreeBuilder}] Add to the {\normalfont \ttfamily treeBuilder} group;
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily metaDataProvenance}] Add to the {\normalfont \ttfamily provenance} group,
\end{description}
{\normalfont \ttfamily label} is a label for this metadatum and {\normalfont \ttfamily value} is the value to store. Currently integer, double precision and character data types are supported for metadata.\\

\noindent \emph{Exporting the data:} Once the data has been read, units and properties specified and any metadata added, the trees can be exported to an HDF5 file using:
\begin{verbatim}
  call mergerTrees%export(outputFile,outputFormat,hdfChunkSize,hdfCompressionLevel)
\end{verbatim}
where {\normalfont \ttfamily outputFile} is the name of the file to which the trees should be exported, {\normalfont \ttfamily outputFormat} specifies the format to use (see \S\ref{sec:mergerTreeBuilderFileFormats}), and {\normalfont \ttfamily hdfChunkSize} and {\normalfont \ttfamily hdfCompressionLevel} respectively give the chunk size and compression level to use when writing the file.

\subsection{File Formats}\label{sec:mergerTreeBuilderFileFormats}\index{merger trees!file formats}

The merger tree file builder engine can currently export in one of two formats. These formats can be specified on the command line to both \hyperlink{Millennium_Merger_Tree_File_Maker.F90}{{\normalfont \ttfamily Millennium\_Merger\_Tree\_File\_Maker.F90}}, and \hyperlink{Simple_Merger_Tree_File_Maker.F90}{{\normalfont \ttfamily Simple\_Merger\_Tree\_File\_Maker.F90}}:
\begin{description}
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily galacticus}] merger trees are exported in \glc's native format described in detail in \S\ref{sec:MergerTreeFormatDescription};
 \item [{\normalfont \ttfamily irate}] merger trees are exported in the \href{https://bitbucket.org/eteq/irate-format}{\normalfont \ttfamily IRATE} format.
\end{description}

\subsection{Exporting Trees from \glc}\index{merger trees!exporting}

By setting {\normalfont \ttfamily [mergerTreesWrite]}$=${\normalfont \ttfamily true}, \glc\ will export each merger tree generated to the file specified by {\normalfont \ttfamily [mergerTreeExportFileName]} using the format specified by {\normalfont \ttfamily [mergerTreeExportOutputFormat]}. Currently, node indices (plus host indices, which are assumed identical to the node indices), descendent indices, masses and redshifts are exported. Positions and velocities are exported if available. If {\normalfont \ttfamily IRATE}-format output is requested then ``snapshot'' numbers will be assigned to nodes based on the time at which they exist. This usually only makes sense if the nodes are defined on a time grid (i.e. if merger trees were extracted from an N-body simulation, or if trees were re-gridded onto such a time grid; see \S\ref{sec:MergerTreeTimeRegrid}). Export happens after any merger tree pre-evolution tasks (see \S\ref{sec:MergerTreePreEvolveTask}).
