   <description>
    A merger tree operator class which enforces monotonic growth a halo mass along each branch of each merger tree. It does
    this by searching the tree for nodes which are less massive than the sum of the masses of their immediate progenitors, and
    increasing the mass of such nodes to equal the sum of the masses of their immediate progenitors.
