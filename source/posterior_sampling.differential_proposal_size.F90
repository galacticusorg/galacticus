   <description>
    Class providing proposal sizes for differential evolution posterior samplers. Specifically, this class provides the proposal
    size parameter, $\gamma$ (the fraction of the vector connecting to chain state to be used as the proposal for another chain),
    for use in differential evolution simulations.
