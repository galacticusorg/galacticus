  ! Canonical value of the total energy input from a single stellar population of 1 M☉ after infinite time. All feedback
  ! calculations which don't specifically use the energy input should be scaled to this value if they want to have the correct
  ! time and IMF dependencies. Value was computed for a Salpeter IMF. Units are M☉ (km/s)².
