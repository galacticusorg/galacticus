    Class providing models of bar instabilities in galactic disks.

   <method name="timescale" >
    <description>
     Returns a timescale on which the bar instability depletes material from a disk into a pseudo-bulge. A negative value
     indicates no instability. Also returns the net torque due to any external force causing this instability, and the fraction of
     the angular momentum of the material depleted into the pseudo-bulge which is retained by the disk and the spheroid.
