Generates plots of dark matter halo progenitor mass functions produced
using the Parkinson, Cole & Helly (2008;
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008MNRAS.383..557P) plus Cole et
al. (2000; http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000MNRAS.319..168C) algorithms
for merger tree building and compares them with measurements from the
Millennium Simulation.

To perform this test, do:

make Galacticus.exe
Galacticus.exe tests/progenitorMassFunction/Progenitor_Mass_Function_Parameters.xml
tests/progenitorMassFunction/Progenitor_Mass_Function.pl

The resulting plot should then exist in:

tests/progenitorMassFunction/progenitorMassFunction.pdf
