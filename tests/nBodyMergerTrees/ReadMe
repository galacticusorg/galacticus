Generates a set of models using both Monte Carlo (modified
Press-Schechter) merger trees and N-body merger trees from the
Millennium Simulation and creates plots comparing various properties
from them. Note that you'll need a log-in for the Millennium database to
be able to download the necessary data.

To perform this test, do:

tests/nBodyMergerTrees/getMillenniumTrees.pl
make Galacticus.exe
scripts/aux/launch.pl tests/nBodyMergerTrees/modelsToRun.xml
tests/nBodyMergerTrees/comparisonPlots.pl

The resulting plots should then exist in:

tests/nBodyMergerTrees/plots
